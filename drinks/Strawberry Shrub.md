title: Strawberry Shrub
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup of fresh strawberries
* 1 cup of sugar
* 1 cup of apple cider vinegar

## Directions

Slice the strawberries, cover well with sugar, and let sit in refrigerator for about 24 hours.

Strain the strawberry syrup through a sieve into a glass jar, pressing the fruit solids with a spoon to extract as much juice as possible. Add vinegar and let sit in refrigerator for seven days, shaking periodically to stir.

Serve as about 1:5 ratio of shrub to club soda.

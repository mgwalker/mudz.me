---

## Ingredients

### Lemongrass Syrup

* 1 cup sugar
* 3 lemongrass stalks, bruised and roughly chopped
* 1 cup water

### Infused Apple Juice

* 10 ounces unsweetened apple juice
* 1 small sprig rosemary

### Sangria

* 24 ounces Albarino (or Godello, Verdejo, or Riesling)
* 7 1/2 ounces sake
* 2 ounces lemon juice
* 5 ounces club soda
* 2 kiwis, peeled and cubed
* 2 green apples, peeled and cubed
* 2 Anjou or Asian pears, peeled and cubed

## Directions

To make the syrup, combine the sugar, lemongrass, and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Allow to boil for 2 - 3 minutes, then remove from the heat. Allow to cool, then strain.

To make the infused apple juice, place the apple juice and rosemary in a blender and blend for about 20 seconds. Strain through a fine mesh sieve.

To make the sangria, add the Albarino, sake, lemon juice, and club soda to a punch bowl or large pitcher. Add the apple juice and 3 ounces of the lemongrass syrup, and whisk together briefly. Add the fruit and serve.

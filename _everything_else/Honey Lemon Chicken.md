title: Honey Lemon Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 3/4 lb chicken breast, cut into thin strips
* Oil, for deep-frying
* Toasted sesame seeds, to garnish

### Marinade

* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1 Tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch
* 2 Tablespoons water

### Batter

* 1 egg, lightly whisked
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Sauce

* 3 Tablespoons honey
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 Tablespoon lemon juice

## Directions

Marinate the chicken for 10 minutes. Lightly whisk the egg and mix in
the rest of the frying batter ingredients. The batter should not be
lumpy, nor too runny, but smooth. Drop the chicken into the batter and
mix until they are all well coated. Combine all the ingredients in the
honey lemon sauce well and set aside.

Heat up a wok with the oil on medium high heat. Gently drop the battered
chicken, make sure it is spread out to prevent sticking together while
frying. Deep fry the chicken strips to golden brown. Dish out and drain
on paper towels.

In a saucepan, gently pour in the sauce and bring to a light simmer.
Give it a quick stir until the sauce bubbles. Remove from heat. Top with
sesame seeds and serve with steamed rice.

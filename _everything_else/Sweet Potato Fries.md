## Ingredients

* Sweet potatoes
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper

## Directions

Line a sheet tray with parchment. In a large bowl toss sweet potatoes
with just enough oil to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread
sweet potatoes in single layer on prepared baking sheet, being sure not
to overcrowd. Bake until sweet potatoes are tender and golden brown,
turning occasionally, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes before
serving.

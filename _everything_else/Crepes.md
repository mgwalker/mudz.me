## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup soda water
* 3/4 cup milk
* 3 Tablespoons melted butter
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup flour

## Directions

In a blender, combine the milk, melted butter, eggs, and soda water.
Blend for 10 seconds. Add in the flour and blend until combined. Place
the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Heat a small nonstick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter
into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30
seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to a cutting
board. Lay the crepes out flat so they can cool. Continue until all the
batter is gone.

After the crepes have cooled, you can stack them and store in resealable
plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for
up to two months. When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently
peeling apart.

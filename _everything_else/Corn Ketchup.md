title: Corn Ketchup
---

## Ingredients

* 4 ears corn
* 1 large shallot, minced (about 6 Tablespoons)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 Tablespoon peanut oil
* 1 Tablespoon ginger, grated
* 1/4 teaspoon coriander
* 1/8 teaspoon allspice
* 3/4 cup coconut milk
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 Tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1 Tablespoon brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons lime juice

## Directions

Using a box grater, grate the corn into a large bowl, getting as much
corn and juice as possible (it should yield about 2 1/4 cups).

Heat the peanut oil in a tall-sided, medium sauce pan over medium-low
heat and gently cook shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt, the
coriander, and the allspice until just beginning to brown. Stir in
ginger and cook for another minute. Add corn, coconut milk, and water
and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook another two
minutes.

Pour mixture into a blender and cool briefly while you wipe out the pot.
Blend until very smooth, strain through a fine mesh strainer, and return
to pot. Discard solids.

Turn heat to medium-high and add vinegar and brown sugar to corn
mixture. Cook, stirring often to keep the bottom from sticking and
burning, until mixture is thick---like ketchup. It will sputter and spit
a bit. Turn off heat, stir in lime juice, and add salt and pepper to
taste.

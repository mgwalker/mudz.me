title: Butternut Squash Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 1 bay leaf
* 4 to 6 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
* Leaves from 1 bunch fresh sage
* 1 large butternut squash, halved and seeded
* 1 small acorn squash, halved and seeded
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 3 leeks, white parts only, cleaned and sliced
* 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
* 3 shallots, sliced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1/4 cup white miso
* 6 cups vegetable stock or low-sodium broth
* Cayenne
* Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Rub the squash with olive oil and season with
salt and pepper. Place the butternut squash, cut side down, on a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper, and tuck sage leaves under. Roast for
10 minutes, then add the acorn squash, cut side down. Roast 25 minutes
longer. Remove and let cool. Scoop the squash halves and pass the flesh
through a potato ricer or food mill. Set aside.

In a large stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks,
carrots, shallots, garlic, parsley, and bay, and sweat 10 minutes. Stir
the honey and miso into the vegetables. Add the pureed squash and the
vegetable stock. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20
minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.

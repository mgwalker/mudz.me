title: Mexican Tomato Sauce
---

## Ingredients

* 3 white onion slices with the skins on
* 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 1 stick true cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 3 or 4 whole peeled tomatoes, canned
* 1/4 cup reserved tomato juice
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* Salt to taste

## Directions

Roast the onion slices and garlic in a cast iron skillet over medium
heat until soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to
cool. Roast the cinnamon stick, turning often, for about 2 minutes. The
stick should give off its aroma. Peel the onions and garlic skins.

In a blender, add the tomatoes, tomato juice, oregano, onion, and
garlic. Blend until smooth.

In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and then add the
tomato mixture with the cinnamon stick, stirring constantly. Raise heat
to medium-high for a gentle simmer and keep stirring until the mixture
is a thick sauce, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. Remove the
cinnamon stick.

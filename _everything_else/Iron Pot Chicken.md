title: Iron Pot Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons fish sauce
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 3 large shallots, chopped
* 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cubed
* 10 fresh Thai bird chiles, stemmed and crushed
* 1 Tablespoon minced ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 3/4 cup chicken stock or water
* 1 Tablespoon cilantro, minced

## Directions

In a small bowl, combine the fish sauce and sugar, and set aside.

In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the shallots and stir until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the fish sauce mixture and stir until the sugar caramelizes and turns golden brown. 

Add the chicken and stir until opaque, about 2 minutes. Add the chiles, ginger, and black pepper, and stir for 2 minutes. Add the stock, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is reduced and thickened, and the chicken is cooked, about 5 more minutes.

Stir in the cilantro and serve over rice.

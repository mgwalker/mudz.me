---

## Ingredients

* 5 Tablespoons olive oil
* 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced
* 700 grams sweet potato, diced
* 2 teaspoons ras el hanout
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed sea salt
* 2 large onions, chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 Tablespoon harissa paste
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 Tablespoons pomegranate molasses
* 100 grams dried dates, chopped
* 100 grams dried apricots, chopped
* 14 ounces canned chickpeas, drained
* 1 cup vegetable stock
* 25 grams cilantro, chopped
* 25 grams flat-leaf parsley, chopped
* juice of 1 lemon

## Directions

Heat the oven to 425Â° F.

Spread the sweet potato into a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle
with 2 Tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle over the ras el hanout
and salt, and toss to coat. Roast for 20 minutes, then remove from the
oven and set aside to cool.

Heat the remaining 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in a deep-sided frying pan
or large saucepan and add the onions and garlic. Cook over medium heat
for 5 minutes, until starting to soften, then add the chicken. Cook
another 4-5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Add the
harissa paste, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, ginger, and cinnamon. Cook for
2 minutes, then stir in the pomegranate molasses, dates, apricots and
chickpeas. Add in the vegetable stock and cook until the sauce has
reduced to almost nothing and the mixture is sticky, about 4-5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro, parsley and lemon juice.
set aside to cool, then carefully fold in the roasted squash and sweet
potato.

title: Sweet Potato and Peanut Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon olive oil
* 1 1/2 cups chopped onions
* 1 clove garlic, sliced
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
* 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed
* 1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 cup salted peanuts
* 1 Tablespoon minced ginger

## Directions

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and
cook until translucent. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, and red
pepper flakes, stirring constantly for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes,
sweet potatoes, carrot, sugar, and broth. Bring to a boil and reduce
heat to low. Cover and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 25
minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool 10-15 minutes. Stir in the
peanuts and ginger.

Blend the soup in a blender or food processor until smooth, in batches
if necessary. Return the soup to the pan and bring to a boil. Remove
from heat and serve.

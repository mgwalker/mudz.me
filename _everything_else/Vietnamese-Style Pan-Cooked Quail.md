title: Vietnamese-Style Pan-Cooked Quail
---

## Ingredients

* 8 quail
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 Tablespoon ginger, minced
* 2 Tablespoons garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup lime juice or rice vinegar
* 1/2 cup nam pla or soy sauce
* 1/4 cup peanut oil

## Directions

Cut along the breastbone of each bird, then straight down through where
the thigh meets body to get 2 semi-boneless halves from each bird.
Combine other ingredients (except oil) and marinate for at least an
hour, or overnight.

Drain quail of marinade, and strain and reserve marinade. Pat birds dry.
Add oil to a large skillet and turn heat to high. When oil is hot, saut√©
quail, skin-side down, until nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and
brown other side for 2 or 3 minutes, or until quail are cooked through.
Remove to a platter and keep warm.

Lower heat and remove any excess from skillet. Add strained marinade,
along with 1/4 cup water, and raise heat to high. Cook, stirring and
scraping any browned bits from bottom of pan, until liquid is reduced to
about 1/4 cup. Spoon over quail and serve immediately.

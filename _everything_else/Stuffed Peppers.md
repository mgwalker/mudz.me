title: Stuffed Peppers
---

## Ingredients

* 15 small peppers, either sweet peppers or mild chili peppers
* corn starch
* olive oil

### Filling

* 1/2 pound ground beef, about 90% lean
* 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
* 1 egg
* 3 Tablespoons soft breadcrumbs
* 2 Tablespoons milk or plain yogurt
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
* a few grinds black pepper
* a few grates nutmeg

## Directions

Cut the peppers in half and remove the stem ends. Remove the seeds and
the white parts inside.

Mix the filling ingredients together and knead well with your hands, to
form a paste like consistency.

Put the pepper halves in a plastic bag with some cornstarch or potato
starch. Shake to coat the peppers. When you take the peppers out of the
bag, shake off any excess starch. (You want the insides to be coated,
but not much on the outsides.)

Fill each pepper half with the meat mixture, pressing it in well to
eliminate any air holes.

Heat up a large frying pan and add a little olive oil to coat the
bottom. Put the stuffed peppers in meat side down. Cook over medium-high
heat until the meat surface is browned, then put on a tight fitting lid,
turn the heat down to low, and steam-cook the peppers until cooked
through and the peppers are tender. This takes about 8 to 10 minutes. Do
not turn the peppers over. Drain on paper towels and serve.

title: Egg Roll-Up
---

## Ingredients

* 6 eggs
* 1 Tablespoon dried parsley
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* olive oil
* small flour tortillas

## Directions

Crack the eggs into a bowl, then add the parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and give everything a good mix.

Heat a small frying pan over a medium heat, and drizzle in two teaspoons of oil.

Pour 3 Tablespoons of the egg mixture into the pan and cook for 30 seconds. Cover with a tortilla and press with a spatula. When the egg has stuck to the tortilla, flip it over and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove to a plate, cool slightly, and roll.

Repeat until the eggs are gone.

## Ingredients

### Bread

* 450 grams bread flour
* 315 grams water
* 75 grams sourdough starter
* 8 grams salt

### Filling

* 400 grams shredded mozzarella
* 170 grams full-fat ricotta
* 170 grams crumbled feta cheese
* 1 egg 
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### Topping

* 4 eggs
* 2 Tablespoons chopped chives

## Directions

Mix all the dough ingredients in a bowl until they're well incorporated.
Lightly flour your countertop and removed the dough from the bowl. Knead it for 3-5 minutes, adding more flour if needed.

Let the dough ferment for several hours until it has almost doubled. The total bulk fermentation time will range from 4 - 8 hours depending on your room temperature and starter liveliness. Use the dough bubbliness and expansion as your guide.

Meanwhile, combine all the filling ingredients in a large bowl.

Place a pair of baking sheets in the oven and heat it to 450Â° F.

Pour out the dough onto a lightly floured countertop. Divide the dough into four pieces and roll them into balls. Cover with a damp towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare four pieces of parchment about 12 by 15 inches.

Re-flour the countertop and roll each ball into an oval that is about 3/8-inch thick. Transfer each oval of dough to a sheet of parchment paper.

Lay a line of cheese filling along the long edges of each dough, then fold the dough over the cheese filling. Pinch and twist the ends of both sides of crust together, making a boat shape with two bread handles on each end. Divide the remaining filling roughly in fourths and add it to the center of each dough.

Carefully remove the baking sheets from the oven and place the khachapuris on them, two per sheet. Return the baking sheets to the oven and bake for 12 minutes and then open the oven briefly to crack an egg onto the center of each khachapuri. Bake for an additional 2-3 minutes, or longer if you prefer a more done egg.

Remove from the oven, season to taste with salt and black pepper, and top with chives. Serve hot.

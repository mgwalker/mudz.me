title: Potato Bread
---

## Ingredients

* 1 baking potato, peeled and cut into large chunks, or 1 cup leftover
* mashed potatoes
* 1 cup milk
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons lard
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
* 1 Tablespoon dry yeast
* 1/3 cup warm water
* 5 cups bread flour

## Directions

Boil the potato until soft. Drain and reserve the cooking liquid. Press
the potato through a food mill.

Scald the milk and combine with 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid. Combine
the liquids and potato with the lard, butter, salt, and sugar in a small
bowl. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

Meanwhile, combine the yeast and warm water, and set aside until foamy.
When the potato mixture has cooled, add the yeast mixture. Add the flour
and knead with a dough hook on an electric mixer, until smooth and
glossy, about 7 minutes.

Transfer to a buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a
warm place to rise about 1/2 hour. Punch the dough down and briefly
knead. Butter a 9-inch by 5-inch by 3-inch loaf pan. Place the dough in
the pan, cover with plastic, and let rise until doubled, about 45
minutes.

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Bake 30 minutes, until the bread sounds hollow
when tapped.

## Ingredients


### Dough

* 1 cup warm milk
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1/4 cup butter
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 packages (or 4 1/2 teaspoons) yeast

### Filling

* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 1 pound breakfast sausage
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 red bell pepper, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small green cabbage, chopped into bite sized pieces
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 2 4-ounce jars pimentos
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

## Directions

Heat the milk, water, and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, until steaming. Turn off the heat and leave to cool until warm.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast, and stir through. Add the scalded milk and knead gently until all the flour is worked in.
Cover and put in warm place for an hour or until doubled in size. Punch
down the dough and form it into 12 balls of roughly equal size. Place the dough in
a baking dish, cover, and leave to rise again, another hour.

Heat the oven to 350Â°F.

Season the ground beef and sausage with salt and pepper. Brown with the onion, red pepper, and garlic. Drain. Add the cabbage and pimientos, and cook until
the cabbage is tender. Turn off heat, add cheese and cover for approximately
1 minute, or until cheese is mostly melted. Stir until mixed
through. Drain off any excess liquid.

Once dough is ready, roll out the dough balls on a floured surface into 6-inch circles.
Place approximately 3/4 cup of the filling in the center of each, pinch to close
and bake on baking sheet for 25 - 35 minutes, or until browned. Rub with
butter while still warm.

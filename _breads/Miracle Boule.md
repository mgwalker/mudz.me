## Ingredients

* 3 cups flour
* 1/4 teaspoon dry active yeast
* 1 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 cups water

## Directions

Mix the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl. Stir in the water to blend.
What you\'ll have is a wet, shaggy, sticky dough, but not so wet as to
be batter. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let it rest in a warm
place for at least 12 hours, and up to 24 hours. It\'s ready for the
next step when the surface is dotted with bubbles.

Flour a work surface and dump the dough out onto it. Sprinkle over a
little more flour and fold it once or twice. Cover with the tea towel
and let rest 15 minutes.

Using only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your fingers,
shape the dough into a ball. Coat a cotton towel with cornmeal, wheat
bran or flour and lay the dough on it, seam-side down. Dust with more
cornmeal, wheat bran or flour. (You need quite a lot because you want to
be sure the dough doesn\'t stick to the towel). Cover and let rise for
about 2 hours. When ready, the dough will be more than double in size.

Half an hour before the dough is ready, preheat the oven to 450Â° F. Put
an 8-quart cast-iron pot or Dutch oven inside to heat.

When the dough is ready, remove the pot from the oven and turn the dough
into it, seam-side up. (It will look messy, but this is OK.) Shake the
pot to settle the bread evenly. Cover with the lid and bake for 30
minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the loaf is nicely browned,
another 15 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack.

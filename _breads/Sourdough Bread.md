title: Sourdough Bread
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup ripe sourdough starter
* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
* 1 teaspoon instant yeast
* 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 5 cups flour

## Directions

Combine all of the ingredients, kneading to form a smooth dough. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator, divide in half, and shape into two oval loaves. Place the loaves on a lined baking sheet, cover with a damp cloth, and allow to double in size, about 90 minutes.

Place a pan with about 2 cups of water on the lowest rack of the oven. Heat the oven to 425° F. Slash the loaves and bake until deep golden brown, 25 - 30 minutes. (The internal temperature should be 200° - 210° F.) Place on a rack to cool.

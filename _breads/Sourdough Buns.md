title: Sourdough Buns
---

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup (170g) ripe sourdough starter
* 3/4 cup (170g) whole milk
* 4 Tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, cubed
* 1 teaspoon instant yeast, optional
* 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup (28g) rye flour, or whole wheat flour
* 2 Tablespoons (25g) potato flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) salt
* 1 Tablespoon sugar
* 1 egg yolk, for egg wash

## Directions

In a small saucepan, heat the milk over low heat until it begins to steam. Turn off the heat, add the butter, and allow to cool until just warm (105° F - 110° F).

In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the sourdough starter, milk, and yeast. Weigh the remaining ingredients and add them to the mixer bowl. With the paddle attachment, mix all the ingredients together for 2 to 3 minutes at low speed to make a sticky, cohesive dough.

Stop the mixer, scrape the bowl, and switch to the dough hook. Turn the mixer up a speed or two and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 to 12 minutes longer. Cover the dough and let it rest in a warm place (75°F to 80°F) for about 4 hours. Stretch and fold over the dough once every hour.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it into eight equal pieces. Shape the dough pieces into tight balls and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Press the balls gently to flatten them slightly. Cover the buns and let them rise until puffy, about 4 hours in a warm place.

Twenty minutes before you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375° F.

Uncover the buns and brush them with the beaten egg yolk. Bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one bun reads at least 190° F. Remove the buns from the oven and allow them to cool before serving.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups (338g) water
* 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt
* 1/2 teaspoon (2g) sugar
* 5 1/2 ounces (155g) unsalted butter, cut into medium dice
* 1 1/2 cups (180g) bread flour
* 1 1/2 cups (189g) grated Gruyère cheese, divided
* 5 large (250g) eggs

## Directions

Combine the water, salt, sugar, and butter in a sauce pot. Bring to a full boil. Remove the pot from the heat and add the flour all at once while stirring constantly. 

Return the pot to the heat and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. There will be a film that develops at the bottom of the pot that indicates the starch in the flour is gelatinizing. Continue to cook for 30 seconds more. 

Transfer the paste to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed for 30 seconds. Add 1 cup of Gruyère the bowl while mixing. Then add the eggs, one at a time, and allow to incorporate fully before adding more. Stop the mixing halfway through the egg addition to scrape down the mix; this ensures no lumps. 

Place plastic wrap on the surface of the batter and refrigerate for 45 minutes. 

Heat the oven to 400°F. Drop 1-ounce scoops of batter onto a non-stick mat or parchment paper. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Gruyère over the top. 

Bake for 15 minutes, open the oven to allow steam to escape, and rotate the pan; finish baking for 15 more minutes, or until gougères are golden brown on the top and sides. They should have a firm crust and hollow interior. Remove from the oven and immediately remove to wire racks. Use a toothpick or skewer to carefully poke a hole in the bottom of each gougere to allow steam to escape.

Serve immediately; freeze any extras after they cool.

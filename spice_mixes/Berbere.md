## Ingredients

* 50 grams medium-hot red chiles, such as guajillo or New Mexico

* 1 teaspoon garlic powder

* 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1/4 teaspoon dried besobela
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt

## Directions

Remove and idscard the stems of the chiles and, if the variety is on the hotter side, shake out the seeds. Grind in an electric spice grinder and transfer to a mixing bowl.

Heat a small frying pan over medium-low heat and separately toast the nigella seeds, cloves, and ajowan seeds for about 2 minutes each, stirring shaking the pan until aromatic. Transfer the toasted spices to the mixing bowl, add the onion powder, garlic powder, ginger, cardamom, besobela, cinnamon, and salt, and stir to combine.

## Ingredients

* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1/2 cup cumin seeds
* 1/2 cup coriander seeds
* 2 Tablespoons black peppercorns
* 6 green cardamom pods
* 1 teaspoon whole cloves
* 2 Tablespoons ground turmeric

## Directions

Break the cinnamon stick into several pieces, then place it into a small, heavy skillet along with the cumin, coriander, peppercorns, cardamom, and cloves. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until aromatic and the spices are lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.

Once cool, transfer to an electric spice grinder and grind to a fine powder, in batches if necessary. Sift through a fine mesh sieve and regrind any bits that are left. Add the turmeric, stir to combine, and transfer to an airtight jar. Store in a cool, dry place.

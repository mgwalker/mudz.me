## Ingredients

* 1 ripe avocado
* 2 tomatillos
* 1 cup cilantro
* 1 lime
* 1/2 jalapeño, roughly chopped
* 1 clove garlic, chopped

## Directions

Peel and rinse the tomatillos. Place them in a pot of boiling water and
boil for five minutes. Remove them and set aside to cool.

Combine all the ingredients in a food processor, along with 1/2 teaspoon
of the jalapeño seeds.Run the food processor
until the sauce is blended. If the sauce seems too thick, add 1
Tablespoon of water and blend again -- continuing until it reaches your
desired consistency.

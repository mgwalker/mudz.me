## Ingredients

* 5 cups kosher salt
* 5 Tablespoons sugar
* 6 lemons, scrubbed and quartered 

## Directions

In a large bowl, mix the salt with the sugar. Toss the lemons with half of the sugar-salt. Pour a small layer of sugar-salt into a clean quart-size jar. Layer the lemons in the jar, covering them with the remaining sugar-salt as you go. Refrigerate the lemons for at least 2 weeks. 

To use, rinse the lemons well and use the peel only.

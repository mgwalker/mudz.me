title: Cream Cheese
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pint heavy cream
* 3 Tablespoons lemon juice

## Directions

Pour the cream into a heatproof bowl and place over a pan of simmering
water. Once the cream is warm, stir in the lemon juice. Continue to
heat, stirring occasionally, until the cream reaches 180Â° F. Remove from
the heat.

Line a colander or strainer with cheesecloth, and place over a bowl.
Pour the mixture into the strainer, and let it drain for several hours,
or overnight in the refrigerator. Spoon the resulting cheese into a
clean container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

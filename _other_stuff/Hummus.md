## Ingredients

* 1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 4 cloves garlic, grated
* 1/3 cup lemon juice
* 1/4 cup warm water
* 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco
* 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 cup tahini
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Add the chickpeas and their water to a large saucepan. Add enough water to cover the chickpeas by two inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 2 - 3 hours. Once tender, add the baking powder and continue simmering for another 25 minutes. Leave to cool.

Remove the skins from the chickpeas and discard. Add the chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, water, hot sauce, paprika, tahini, and olive oil to the bowl of a food processor and blend until smooth. Season to taste.

title: Butter Naan
description: Indian flatbread
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup plain yogurt
* 1/2 cup lukewarm milk
* 2 Tablespoons melted butter
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons grated garlic
* 1 teaspoon active yeast

### Topping

* 3 Tablespoons melted butter
* 6 cloves garlic, minced

## Directions

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, garlic, and yeast. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine.

Knead the dough until it turns smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat both sides, then cover and allow to it to rest until doubled in size, 1 - 2 hours.

Deflate the dough and divide it into 8 equal portions. Keep the unrolled dough covered while shaping the naan.

On a lightly-floured work surface, roll out each portion of dough into an oval about 8 inches long and 5 inches wide. Sprinkle some of the minced garlic over the top, and press down to help it stick to the dough.

When all the naan are rolled, heat a griddle or pan over medium-high heat. One at a time, cook each naan until it begins to form bubbles, about 1 minute. Turn the naan over and cook until it browns, another 1 - 2 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and brush with the melted butter. Serve warm.

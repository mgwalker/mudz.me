title: Country Crust Bread Rolls
---

## Ingredients

* 2 1/4 teaspoons dry active yeast
* 1 cup warm water
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 3 - 3 1/2 cups bread flour
* Butter, softened

## Directions

Dissolve the yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine the sugar,
egg, oil, salt, and 1 1/2 cups of flour until smooth. Add enough flour to
make the dough slightly sticky and easy to handle. Turn the dough onto a
lightly floured surface and knead 8 - 10 minutes. Place the dough in a
greased bowl. Turn the dough over and cover with plastic wrap. Set in a
warm place to rise until doubled in size, at least 1 hour.

Deflate the dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Pull the
dough into pieces and roll into 2-inch balls. Place the balls into
greased baking dishes. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place
to rise until doubled in size, at least 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 375Â° F. Remove plastic wrap and bake until deep golden
brown, 15 - 20 minutes. Brush with butter while still warm.

## Ingredients

### Bread

* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 1 1/2 Tablespoon butter
* 3 1/2 - 4 cups white flour
* 1 Tablespoon active dry yeast 
* 2 Teaspoons salt 
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar

### Topping

* 1 Tablespoon active dry yeast
* 1/2 cup lukewarm water
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
* 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 - 1 cup rice flour

## Directions

Melt the butter in a saucepan over gentle heat, then add the milk. Heat until just below a simmer, then remove from the heat and leave to cool (about 105Â° F).

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour with the yeast, sugar, and salt. Add the milk and butter, and mix on low until everything is combined in a somewhat sticky dough. Raise the speed to medium and mix until the dough is elastic, tacky, and smooth, 5 - 8 minutes. If the dough is too soft, add the remaining flour. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a greased bowl. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and leave to rise until doubled in size, 1 - 2 hours.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 - 12 portions. Roll each portion into a ball, place on the baking sheet at least 1 inch apart, and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Leave to rise for 30 - 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the topping. Beat together all the topping ingredients into a thick batter that drips off the spoon in thick clumps.If the mixture is too thin, add the remaining 1/4 cup of rice flour. Leave to rest for 15 minutes.

Once the rolls have risen, spoon the topping in equal amounts over the top. Scoop up any batter that falls on the pan and patch any spots that are not covered. Use all the mixture.

Bake the rolls in the for 15 - 18 minutes, until golden brown on top. Serve warm.

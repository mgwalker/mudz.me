## Ingredients

### Levain
* 113 grams ripe sourdough starter
* 113 grams warm water
* 226 grams bread flour

### Dough
*  60 grams warm water
* 3 large eggs, plus 1 for glazing
* 8 grams salt
* 55 grams vegetable oil
* 65 grams mild honey, or 60 grams sugar
* 400 grams bread flour

## Directions

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the starter with the warm water and bread flour. Mix until combined. This is a stiff starter, so it will take some work to get all the flour mixed in. Do not add extra water. You might need to do a little kneading to get it to all mix in. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and allow to sit on the counter overnight 8-12 hours.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the warm water, eggs, salt, vegetable oil, and honey. Whisk until the salt is dissolved. Mix the bread flour in all at once. When the mixture is a shaggy ball, scrape it out onto your work surface. Add the levain and knead until the dough is smooth, about 10 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and allow to ferment at room temperature for 2 hours. It will probably not rise much, if at all.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into four even balls. Roll each ball into a long thin strip the same length as your baking sheet, working from the middle, out. Place the strips on the baking sheet and bring the top points together. Pinch the four strands together. Starting with the strand on the right, pass it over the next strand, under the third strand, and over the fourth strand on the left. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end, pinch the ends together, and tuck both ends under the loaf. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and allow the loaf to proof until tripled in size, about 5 hours.

Heat the oven to 350Â° F.

In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with a pinch of salt. Brush the egg glaze over the loaf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until well browned.

Remove the bread from the baking sheet and cool completely on a wire rack.

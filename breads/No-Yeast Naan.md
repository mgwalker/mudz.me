## Ingredients

* 500 grams flour
* 2 Tablespoons nigella seeds or cumin seeds
* 5 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 cup whole milk
* oil

## Directions

Heat the oven to 465Â° F. Place a sheet pan in the oven while it heats up.

Mix the flour in a bowl with the nigella seeds, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, then use a palette knife to bring the dough together. Knead on a floured surface for 10 minutes, or, if you are using a dough hook on a mixer, knead for 5 minutes. Then leave the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough into 8 equal portions, then roll them all out as thin as you can get them. Take the hot tray out of the oven and brush its surface with oil. Add as many bits of rolled dough as will fit. Bake for 2 minutes, until lightly browned, and lightly brush the tops with oil once you have taken them out of the oven. Repeat until all the dough is cooked.

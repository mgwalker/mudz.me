title: Cornbread Muffins
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups flour
* 3/4 cup cornmeal
* 1 1/4 cup corn flour
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 1/3 cups sugar
* 4 eggs
* 2 cups sour cream

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Grease a regular muffin tin, or line with paper cups.

Sift together the flour, cornmeal, corn flour, and baking soda.

In a stand mixer, cream together the butter, sugar, and salt. Add the eggs and beat on medium-low speed until combined. Gradually beat in the dry ingredients, then fold in the sour cream.

Fill each of the cups of the muffin tin about 2/3 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 8 - 12 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

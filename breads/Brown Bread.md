title: Brown Bread

## Ingredients


* 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1 1/4 cups warm water
* 1 Tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 cup honey
* 300 grams bread flour
* 170 grams whole wheat flour
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon espresso powder
* 2 Tablespoons molasses
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup cornmeal
* 1/4 cup rolled oats

## Directions

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, warm water and sugar. Let sit for 5 minutes until foamy. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, sift together the bread flour, whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Set aside.

To the mixer, add the honey, molasses and espresso powder. Stir to combine and then add the sifted ingredients to the mixer.

Mix on low for three minutes, then increase the speed to medium and mix for another 5 - 8 minutes. The dough is ready when it’s smooth and begins to pull away from the sides of the mixer. The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl and cover. Let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size. 

Spread a bit of cornmeal out on a piece of parchment paper. Then, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into four equal-sized portions. Roll each portion into a smooth log, about 12 inches long, and press the bottom of each loaf into the cornmeal to lightly coat the bottom.

Arrange the loaves on a parchment-lined baking sheet, about 4 inches apart. Gently brush the loaves with water and sprinkle lightly with rolled oats. Cover loosely with a clean towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for another hour. The loaves are ready when the dough is puffed and doubled in size.

Heat the oven to 350°. Uncover the loaves and bake for 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

## Directions

Heat the oven to 400° F. Generously butter a 9-inch by 13-inch baking

Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Combine the
cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in a second bowl. Beat together
the eggs and milk in a third bowl. Alternating between the two, mix the
flour and eggs into the butter, until just mixed. Fold in the jalapeños

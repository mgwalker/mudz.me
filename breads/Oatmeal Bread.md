title: Oatmeal Bread
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1 cup boiling milk
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 1 Tablespoon yeast
* 1/4 cup warm water
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 1/4 cup honey
* 2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour

### Topping

* 1 Tablespoon milk
* 1 Tablespoon water
* 2 Tablespoons rolled oats

## Directions

In a large heatproof bowl, combine the oatmeal, boiling milk, and butter. Cover, and let stand for 2 hours.

Dissolve the yeast into the water, then add to the bowl with the oatmeal along with the remaining ingredients. Stir until well combined. If the dough is too wet, add more flour until it’s smooth.

Press the dough into a loaf pan (or form it into a ball), cover, and leave to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about an hour.

Heat the oven to 350° F. To make the topping, stir together the milk and water. Brush the loaf with the milk and then sprinkle the oats evenly over the top. Bake 40 - 45 minutes, or until an internal thermometer reads 190° F.

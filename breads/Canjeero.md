## Ingredients

* 1 cup fine white cornmeal
* 1 teaspoon dry active yeast
* 5 cups warm water, divided
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon canola oil

## Directions

Place the cornmeal, yeast, and 2 cups of water in a large bowl and stir together vigorously. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and leave at room temperature until small bubbles appear on the surface and the mixture has risen slightly, about 1 hour.

Add the sugar, baking powder, salt, and remaining 3 cups of water to the bowl and stir well to combine. Whisk in the flour until smooth. Cover and leave at room temperature for 4 - 24 hours.

When ready to cook, add the oil to a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Once hot, stir the batter well and ladle it into the skillet to form a thin, even layer across the bottom, tilting the pan to coat the surface. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until no liquid remains on the surface and the bottom is barely browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate, and repeat with the remaining batter (no more oil is necessary). Serve warm.

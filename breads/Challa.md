## Ingredients

* 4 cups bread flour
* 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 2 eggs at room temperature, plus 1 egg for egg wash
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 1 teaspoon salt

## Directions

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, yeast and warm water. Stir to combine. Add the sugar, 2 of the eggs, oil and salt. Mix the dough with the dough hook until a smooth dough emerges, about five minutes.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead by hand for an additional five minutes. The dough should be smooth, elastic and not sticky. Place the dough in a bowl that has been oiled on all sides. Cover the dough and allow it to rise in a warm place for two hours or until doubled in size.

Punch down risen dough and divide into three equal portions. Gently roll each portion into a thin rope, 26 - 28 inches long. Braid the strands of dough together, tuck in the ends, cover, and leave to rise for 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 350° F. Beat the remaining egg and brush over the dough. Bake until deep brown, and the internal temperature reaches 190° F, about 35 minutes.

Cool before slicing.

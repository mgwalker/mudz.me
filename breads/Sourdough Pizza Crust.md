title: Sourdough Pizza Crust
---

## Ingredients

* 227 grams sourdough starter, unfed
* 170 grams cup water, lukewarm
* 300 grams all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon yeast

## Directions

Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Knead on a lightly-floured surface for 12 - 15 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly-greased bowl, cover, and seat aside to rise until doubled, 2 - 4 hours.

Heat the oven to 450Â° F.

Oil a round pizza pan. Place the dough in the pan and press it out to the edges. If it shrinks back, leave it to rest for 15 minutes.

Add sauce and toppings, and bake 15 - 17 minutes. Cut into slices and serve.

title: Jamaican Plantain Dumplings
---

## Ingredients

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 ripe plantain, peeled and cut into coins
* Vegetable oil, for frying

## Directions

Add the flour, salt and baking powder to a food processor and pulse to combine. Toss in the cold butter cubes and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs.

Gradually add the milk until it is completely worked into the dough. Once it comes together into a consistent ball and pulls away from the sides of the food processor, divide the dough into 12 even balls. Push a slice of plantain into the middle of each ball and pinch the dough around the plantain so it is completely covered by the dough. Press each ball flat into a cake, cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before frying.

Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. Prick the dumplings all over with a fork. Working in batches, pan-fry dumplings until golden and slightly puffy, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Season with salt and serve warm.

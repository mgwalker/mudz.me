title: Potato Burger Buns
---

## Ingredients

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup potato flour
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 1/4 teaspoons table salt
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter
* 1 cup water, lukewarm

## Directions

Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them to make a soft dough, 5 - 10 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it's almost doubled in bulk.

Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place the balls onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 2" to 3" between them; flatten gently. Cover and let rise until the buns have doubled in size, 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350Â° F.

Bake the buns for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're light golden brown.

Transfer the buns to a rack to cool. Store buns, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.

## Ingredients

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups whole milk
* 2 Tablespoons cilantro, minced
* 1/4 cup canola oil, divided

## Directions

Whisk together the flours, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large heat-proof bowl. Warm the milk in a saucepan over medium heat until it begins steaming, about 2 minutes. Add the milk, cilantro, and 2 Tablespoons of oil to the flour and stir until a shaggy dough forms.

Turn out the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until very elastic, 10 - 15 minutes. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, and turn it over to coat all sides. Cover with a clean towel and allow to rise until puffy and soft, about 45 minutes.

Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured surface and divide it into 8 equal pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll out each piece into an oval about 8 inches long and 1/4-inch thick. Brush a thin layer of oil over the surface of the dough, then fold the dough in half; repeat. Use a rolling pin to again flatten the dough into a large oval.

Set a large, heavy skillet over medium heat and allow it to warm up for 2 minutes. Place one piece of dough in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to form on the surface and the underside is brown, about 2 minutes. Flip the dough, reduce the heat to low, and use a spatula to press down on the dough to ensure that all the edges make contact with the pan. Cook until browned, about 2 more minutes. Remove to a plate. Repeat for the remaining pieces of dough. Serve warm.

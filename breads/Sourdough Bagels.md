title: Sourdough Bagels
---

## Ingredients

* 400 grams starter
* 150 grams water
* 550 grams flour
* 38 grams oil
* 25 grams brown sugar, plus two Tablespoons, divided
* 15 grams salt

## Directions

Add all the ingredients (except for 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar) to a large bowl and mix, kneading occasionally, until all the flour is incorporated. Cover, and leave to rise in a warm place for 3 - 4 hours.

Divide the dough into 100 gram portions and shape into balls. Poke a hole in the middle of each ball with your finger, and stretch the hole to into a donut shape. Place the shaped bagels onto a sheet tray, brush lightly with oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.

The next day, remove the bagels from the refrigerator and leave on the counter for an hour.

Heat the oven to 400Â° F. Fill a pot with water, add 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar, and bring it to a boil. Add 2 - 3 bagels to the pot and boil for 1 minute, turning them over halfway through. Remove to the tray. Repeat for the remaining bagels.

Bake for 20 minutes.

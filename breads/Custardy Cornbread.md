---

## Ingredients
* 1 1/4 cups flour
* 1 cup fine cornmeal
* 1 Tablespoon baking powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 4 eggs
* 15 ounces creamed corn
* 4 1/2 ounces canned green chiles, drained and chopped
* 1/2 cup white cheddar, grated
* 1/2 cup pepper jack, grated
* 6 Tablespoons butter, room temperature
* 1/4 cup sugar
* Canola oil

## Directions

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt.

In another bowl, beat together the eggs, chiles, creamed corn, and cheese. 

In a third bowl, cream together the butter and sugar.

Coat a 13-inch cast iron skillet with canola oil and place in the cold oven. Heat the oven to 450Â° F.

Once the oven is heated, combine the contents of all three bowls together. Take the skillet out of the oven, pour in the batter, and bake until golden and the top has some spring, 30-35 minutes.

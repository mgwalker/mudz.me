## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil

## Directions

Combine the flours, salt, and water in a large bowl and combine to form a thick batter.

Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Set a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tablespoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add half the dough to the skillet and use wet fingertips to carefully press the dough into a wide circle that covers the pan. Cover, and cook until the top of the dough is glossy and the bottom is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip the bread over, cover, and cook until browned, 2 - 3 more minutes. Remove to the plate to drain, and repeat for the remaining dough. Serve warm.

## Ingredients

* 454 grams warm water
* 25 grams sugar, divided
* 18 grams yeast
* 25 grams olive oil
* 645 grams bread flour, plus more for dusting
* 18 grams table salt

## Directions

Add the water, yeast, and half the sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Leave until foamy, 10 - 15 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and mix with a spatula until combined. With the dough hook attachment, mix on medium speed until the dough forms into a ball and pulls away from the sides, 8 - 10 minutes. If necessary, add flour 15 grams at a time until tacky but not sticky.

Knead by hand on a floured surface for 2-3 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn to coat, and cover. Leave to rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 - 1 1/2 hours.

Deflate the dough and divide into 4 equal portions. Cover with a clean cloth and rest 15 minutes. Shape into balls and lightly cover with oiled plastic wrap. Rest another 15 minutes.

Gently shape each ball into an oblong loaf 16 inches long by 3 inches wide. Place onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper, cover with oiled plastic, and rest 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 375° F.

Just before baking the loaves, use a spray bottle to spritz the oven with water. Quickly place the loaves in the oven and close the door. Bake for 30 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle of each loaf reads at least 190° F, rotating halfway through.

Cool on wire racks.

title: Buttermilk Stack Biscuits
---

## Ingredients

* 340 grams all-purpose flour
* 20 grams baking powder
* 1 gram baking soda
* 2 grams kosher salt
* 60 grams leaf lard, chilled
* 30 grams unsalted butter, sliced into very thin pats and chilled
* 245 grams buttermilk, chilled

## Directions

Heat the oven to 450ºF.

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Working quickly (so the fats don't melt), use your fingertips to rub the lard and butter into the dry mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.

Make a well in the center of the dry mixture and pour in the chilled buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will be very sticky. While it’s still in the bowl, fold the dough over on itself two times so that it picks up any remaining flour, and then turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.

Dust the top of the dough with flour and, with floured hands, gently fold the dough over itself eight more times, turning one quarter turn between each folding motion. Press dough into a 1-inch-thick round. Cut out biscuits with a floured 2 1/2-inch cutter, being sure to press straight down through the dough without twisting. Flour the cutter between cuts.

Center the biscuits on a baking sheet, shoulder to shoulder, so that they just touch. Reform the scrap dough, working it as little as possible, and continue cutting until you have 8 biscuits total.

Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees in the oven and continue baking until tall and lightly gold on top, 8 to 12 more minutes.

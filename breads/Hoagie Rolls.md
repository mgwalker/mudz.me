title: Hoagie Rolls

## Ingredients

* 3 1/2 - 4 cups bread flour
* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 2 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup butter, cubed

## Directions

Add the sugar, yeast, and 1/4 cup of water to the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir to dissolve the sugar, then let stand 5 - 10 minutes.

Add 2 cups of flour, the remaining water, and the salt to the bowl and mix for 4 minutes on medium. Add the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time until it is well incorporated, then mix for another 5 - 6 minutes. Add the butter 1 Tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing until it is well incorporated and the dough comes back together. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover, and leave to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down and place on a very lightly floured counter. Divide into 8 pieces and shape into long rolls. Place on a lined baking sheet, cover, and leave to rise until doubled in size, another 30 - 45 minutes.

Heat the oven to 375° F.

Slash the tops of the rolls, and bake 16 - 23 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the rolls reaches 200° F. Allow to cool before slicing.

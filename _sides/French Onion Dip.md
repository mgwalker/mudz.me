title: French Onion Dip
---

## Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 3 large yellow onions, finely diced (about 1 quart)
* 1 tablespoon butter
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup water
* 3/4 cup sour cream
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 ounce finely grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 tablespoon finely sliced chives

## Directions

Heat sugar in a 12-inch stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat
until completely melted and light brown, about 3 minutes. Immediately
add onions and stir with wooden spoon to coat onions in sugar. Add
butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds black pepper. Toss to combine.
Cook, shaking pan occasionally until onions release all their liquid and
brown coating builds up on bottom of pan, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons water shake pan while scraping with wooden spoon to
deglaze brown bits from bottom of pan. Continue cooking, shaking
occasionally until coating begins to build up again, 3 to 5 minutes.
Repeat deglazing and cooking steps three more times until all water is
used up and onions are deep brown. Transfer to medium mixing bowl and
allow to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes.

Add sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, parmesan, and Worcestershire
and whisk to combine. For smoother texture, run through blender or food
processor. Chill in a sealed container for at least 1 hour and up to 5
days (flavor will improve with time). Spoon into a bowl, sprinkle with
chives, and serve with chips.

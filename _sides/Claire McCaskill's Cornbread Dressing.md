---

## Ingredients

* 1/4 pound sausage
* 1/4 pound bacon
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons sage
* 2 teaspoons thyme
* 2--3 celery stalks,chopped
* 1 pan cornbread, cubed and dried
* Chicken broth

## Directions

Heat the oven to 375°F.

Cook the bacon and sausage and remove from pan. Crumble bacon. Using the
grease left in the pan, add 1-2 Tablespoons of olive oil and sauté the
onion and celery until soft. Add the garlic, sage, and thyme, and sauté
another 1-2 minutes.

In a large bowl mix the dried cornbread, bacon, sausage, and vegetables.
Slowly add the chicken broth so the bread absorbs it evenly. The mixture
needs to be very moist or you dressing will be too dry.

Bake for 30 minutes until top browned.

title: Lentil Sambusas
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup black lentils
* 1/2 cup green lentils
* 1 Tablespoon canola oil
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 green chile, diced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/3 cup cilantro, minced
* Salt, to taste
* Spring roll wrappers
* Oil, for frying

## Directions

Rinse the lentils until the water runs clear. Cover the lentils with an
inch of water and soak overnight.

Add the lentils and water to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a
simmer and cook until tender, 20 - 30 minutes. Drain.

Heat the oven to 400° F.

In another pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, chile, and
garlic, and sauté until the onion turns translucent. Add the cardamom,
cinnamon, and black pepper, and sauté another 2 minutes. Add the
lentils, stir to combine, and cook another 10 minutes. Remove from the
heat, stir in the cilantro, and leave to cool.

Dampen the edges of a spring roll wrapper, place a heaping teaspoon of
filling in the center, fold the wrapper into a triangle, and pinch to
seal. Place on a lined baking sheet. Repeat until all the filling is
used.

Brush the sambusas liberally on all sides with oil. Bake until golden
brown, 6 - 10 minutes, flip, and bake another 2 - 3 minutes. Serve.

title: West Texas Black Beans
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound dry black beans
* 1 Tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 Tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 2-3 green chiles
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tomatillos, husks removed and finely chopped
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, plus more for serving
* 1 1/2 teaspoons lime juice

## Directions

Place the beans in a large pot, cover with 2 inches of water, and leave
to soak overnight.

Roast the chiles under the broiler until blackened on both sides, about
10-12 minutes, turning once. Once blackened, place the chiles in a paper
sack or plastic food-storage bag, close it tight and let the chiles
steam for 20 minutes. After the chiles have steamed, remove from the bag
and rub off the skin. Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and
finely chop.

After the beans have soaked, add to the pot the salt, cumin, oregano, chiles, garlic,
tomatillos, and cilantro. Bring the pot to a boil on high, then turn the
heat down to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1 hour.

After an hour, remove the lid, taste the beans and see how firm they are
then continue to cook uncovered until tender, about 1-2 hours, depending
on the beans. Taste and adjust seasonings and stir in the lime juice.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup cooked black beans, drained
* 1 small red bell pepper, diced
* 3 green onions, sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
* 1 Tablespoon butter
* 2 cups corn kernels, fresh or frozen
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* Juice of 1 lime
* 1 Tablespoon hot sauce
* 1 teaspoon chile powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 Tablespoon water
* 1/2 cup cotija cheese, crumbled
* 2 Tablespoons cilantro, minced
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat up 1 teaspoon of olive oil, then add the diced pepper and cook until slightly charred, 2 - 3 minutes. Remove to a large, nonreactive bowl. Add another teaspoon of olive oil to the skillet, and char the green onions, 2 - 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saut√© another 30 seconds. Scrape into the bowl with the pepper. Add another teaspoon of olive oil to the skillet, and cook the corn until softened and lightly charred, 4 - 6 minutes. Stir in the butter, then scrape the corn into the bowl. Add the beans, cotija, and cilantro.

In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, lime juice, hot sauce, chile powder, cumin, and water. Add to the bowl with the corn and beans, toss to coat evenly, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

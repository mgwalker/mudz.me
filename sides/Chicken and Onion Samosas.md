title: Chicken and Onion Samosas
---

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 2 cups flour
* 2/3 cup water
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

### Filling

* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1 large potato, or 2 medium, cubed
* 1 small yellow onion, minced
* 1 small red bell pepper, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon xawaash
* 1/2 pound chicken thighs, diced
* Kosher salt, to taste
* Oil, for frying

## Directions

To make the dough, Mix the flour, salt and baking powder in a bowl. Add the water and oil, and mix until a soft dough forms. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turn the dough over to coat both sides, then cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, make the filling. Place the potato and a large pinch of salt in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potato is tender, 15 - 20 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and xawaash. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and season generously with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, stir in the potato, add salt to taste, and set aside to cool.

Divide the dough into 8 - 12 equal portions. Use a rolling pin to roll each portion into a triangle, about 3 inches per side. Spoon the filling onto the dough, dip a finger into a small bowl of water, and moisten the edges of the dough. Fold the edges of the dough together and press firmly to seal.

In a heavy pot set over medium-high heat, heat 1 inch of oil to a 375Â° F. Fry the samosas in batches until they are browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot.

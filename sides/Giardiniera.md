## Ingredients

* 1/2 head cauliflower, chopped into small florets
* 10 ribs celery, diced
* 5 carrots, diced
* 2 large bell peppers, diced
* 1 cup sliced green pitted olives
* 4 serrano peppers, sliced
* 1/4 cup kosher salt
* Water
* 4 cups white wine vinegar
* 4 cups olive oil

### For each jar
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns
* 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes
* 1/4 teaspoon celery seeds
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 clove garlic, halved

## Directions

In a large container, combine the cauliflower, celery, bell peppers, olives, serranos, and salt, and add enough cold water to cover the vegetables. Cover the container and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Drain the vegetables, but do not rinse. Divide between pint jars and add the seasonings.

In a saucepan, bring the vinegar to a simmer, then pour into the jars until halfway up the side. Top up each jar with olive oil, cover with lids and rings, and process in a water bath for 15 minutes. Remove from the water bath and leave to cool completely.

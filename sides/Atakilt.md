## Ingredients

* 1/2 large head of green cabbage
* 3 Tablespoons canola oil
* 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
* 1 Tablespoon minced garlic
* 1 Tablespoon grated ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
* 3/4 cup hot water
* kosher salt, to taste
* black pepper, to taste

## Directions

Core and chop the cabbage. Place in a large bowl of warm, salted water, stir with your hands to wash the cabbage, then drain.

Heat the oil in a large saut√© pan set over medium-low heat, then add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute. Add the turmeric, and season with salt and pepper.

Add in the cabbage, stirring from the bottom to blend well. Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the hot water, cover, and cook until the potatoes are tender, 20 minutes. Add water as needed to prevent scorching, or remove the lid toward the end of cooking to boil off excess water. The mixture should be moist but watery.

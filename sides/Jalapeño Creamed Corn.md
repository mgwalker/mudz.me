title: Jalapeño Creamed Corn
---

## Ingredients

* 8 ears of corn, shucked, or 6 cups frozen corn
* 2 1/2 cups half and half
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1 jalapeño, seeded and diced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
* Pinch of cayenne
* 1/4 cup crumbled Cotija cheese
* Salt, to taste

## Directions

If using fresh corn, with a knife remove the kernels from the cob. Place
the cobs in a medium pot and pour in the half and half. Turn the heat on
low and let the cobs and half and half cook for 15 minutes. Before
removing the cobs and discarding, scrape the sides to release any more
milky corn essence. If using frozen corn, skip this step, and simply add
the half and half to a blender.

Meanwhile, add the butter to a large skillet and turn the heat on low.
Once the butter has melted, add the corn kernels, fresh or frozen, the
jalapeño, and the garlic. Stirring occasionally, cook the corn for 15
minutes. Add salt to taste.

Remove the kernels from the heat, and place 3/4 of a cup of the kernels
in the blender with the half and half. Blend until smooth.

Add the remaining corn kernels, corn puree, sugar, and cayenne either to
a large cast-iron skillet or a medium pot. Turn the heat on low, and
while stirring occasionally, cook until it's reduced and thickened,
about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.

Turn on the broiler and place a rack six inches away from the heating
element. If using a cast-iron skillet, sprinkle the Cotija cheese evenly
over the creamed corn, place the skillet in the oven, and broil until
lightly browned on top, about 1 to 2 minutes.

If instead you're using a medium pot to cook the creamed corn, lightly
grease a 9-inch casserole dish. Pour in the creamed corn, sprinkle the
Cotija cheese evenly over the creamed corn, and broil until lightly
browned on top, about 1 to 2 minutes.

title: Cumin Roasted Carrots
---

## Ingredients

* 8 slender carrots, with tops
* Olive oil, for drizzling
* 2 teaspoons cumin seed, lightly crushed
* Salt and black pepper

## Directions

Heat the oven to 400Â°F.

Slice the carrots lengthwise, leaving a bit of green top attached, for
looks. Toss on a baking sheet with the olive oil, crushed cumin seed,
and salt and pepper, to taste. Roast until tender and golden-edged,
about 30 minutes, depending on their size. They should be slightly
crinkly and golden-edged.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs carrots 
* 2 Tablespoons sugar 
* 4 garlic cloves, crushed 
* 1 teaspoon coriander 
* 6 Tablespoons olive oil 
* 6 Tablespoons white vinegar 
* Paprika, to taste 
* Salt, to taste
* Pepper, to taste

## Directions

Thinly shred the carrots, then mix with the sugar and crushed garlic. Let it macerate for 10 minutes to get the juices out. Mix with the remaining ingredients. Let marinate for 6 hours.

Mix thoroughly before serving as the juices tend to sit on the bottom of the pan. Serve chilled.

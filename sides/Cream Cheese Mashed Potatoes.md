---

## Ingredients

* 5 large potatoes
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed
* 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 3 - 4 green onions, thinly sliced
* Salt and black pepper, to taste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika

## Directions

Heat oven to 350Â° F. Butter an 8-inch square baking dish.

Cube the potatoes, and place them in a medium pot along with the garlic. Cover with cold water, add 2 Tablespoons salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and boil the potatoes until they are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.

While still hot, add the potatoes to the bowl of stand mixer along with the remaining ingredients. Beat on medium until well combined. Pour into the prepared baking dish and bake until the top is golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the smoked paprika over the top.

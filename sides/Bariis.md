## Ingredients

* 1 cup basmati rice
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 whole cloves
* pinch ground cardamom
* 1 small tomato, finely chopped
* kosher salt, to taste
* 3 Tablespoons golden raisins
* 1 Tablespoon xawaash
* 1 1/2 cups boiling water

## Directions

Place the rice in a fine mesh sieve and rinse with cold water, stirring the rice gently with your hands, until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a bowl, cover with cold water, and leave to soak for 10 - 30 minutes.

Warm the oil in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the cinnamon and cloves, and cook another 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cardamom and cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the tomato, season lightly with salt, and increase the heat to high. Cook until the juice from the tomato has evaporated and the mixture forms a thick paste, about 2 minutes. Drain the rice, add it to the pot, and stir to combine. Season again with salt, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the mixture is dry and the rice is opaque, about 5 minutes. Stir in the raisins, xawaash, and boiling water, cover, and simmer until the rice is cooked, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the rice to steam, covered, for another 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork, and remove the cinnamon stick and cloves. Serve hot.

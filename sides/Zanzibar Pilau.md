## Ingredients

* 1 cup basmati rice
* 2 Tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee
* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 5 green cardamom pods
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/2 cup full-fat unsweetened coconut milk
* 1 cup boiling water
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Directions

Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse with cold tap water, stirring gently with your hands, until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a bowl, cover with cold water, and leave it to soak for 10 - 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the coconut milk, boiling water, and salt. Drain the rice and add it to the pot. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and leave to simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.

Turn off the heat, leaving the pot covered for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods. Serve hot.

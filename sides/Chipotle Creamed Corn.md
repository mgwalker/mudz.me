title: Chipotle Creamed Corn
---

## Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne
* 2 chipotle chiles in adobo, minced
* 5 cups corn kernels, about 8 ears
* 1 cup cream
* 4 ounces cream cheese, cubed
* 2 Tablespoons lime juice

## Directions

In a large skillet, on medium-low heat melt the butter. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

Stir in the salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne, and chipotle chiles until they're well blended with the garlic, then add the corn to the skillet. While stirring, cook the corn with the garlic and spices until fragrant and warm, about 2 minutes.

Add to the skillet the cream and cream cheese and turn the heat to low. While stirring occasionally cook for 15 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and reduced.

Stir in the lime juice then taste and adjust seasonings. Serve warm.

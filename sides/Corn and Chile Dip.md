## Ingredients

* 4 cups frozen corn
* 1 Freson chile, minced
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 3 scallions, sliced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/3 cup cream

## Directions

Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the scallion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp tender, about 6 minutes. Add the heavy cream and chopped chili and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cream cheese until melted, then remove from the heat and season with salt to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with the scallion greens and the chile slices. Serve hot or at room temperature.

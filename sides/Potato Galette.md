title: Potato Galette
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup finely grated aged Pecorino Romano
* 1 Tablespoon potato starch or cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or olive oil
* 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/8-inch-thick

## Directions

Heat your oven to 375Â°F. Combine the cheese, potato starch or
cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a small dish. Taste a pinch; you want it
to have a strong salty-peppery kick, because it's going to be
distributed all over the galette.

Pour 1 Tablespoon butter or oil into the bottom of a 9-inch-diameter
cast-iron or ovenproof skillet, and swirl it up the sides. Arrange the
potatoes in overlapping concentric circles in a single layer at the
bottom of the pan. (This will use approximately a quarter of your sliced
potatoes.) Drizzle with 1 teaspoon butter or oil, and sprinkle with 2
Tablespoons of the cheese-pepper mixture. You'll need to repeat this
three or four times to use up your potatoes (depending on their size).
At the end, you should have about 1 Tablespoon cheese-pepper mixture
left over; reserve this. Drizzle any remaining melted butter over the
top.

Lightly coat a piece of foil with nonstick spray and cover the skillet
tightly with it. Put in heated oven for 35 minutes, at which point the
potatoes will be almost tender. Use potholdered hands to press firmly on
the foil to compact the potatoes a bit. Remove and reserve the foil and
bake for 25 to 30 minutes more, until lightly brown all over. Press
again with the foil, remove, then briefly run under the broiler for an
even golden-brown finish.

Once the galette is out of the oven, let it rest in the skillet for a
few minutes before running a knife around to ensure that it is loose.
Gently tip the skillet over your sink to drain any excess butter or oil.
Invert it onto a plate or cutting board, then flip right side up. Cut
the galette into wedges, and sprinkle with the reserved cheese-pepper
mixture.

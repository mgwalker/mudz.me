title: Carrot Hummus
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* Sunflower seed oil
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 3 Tablespoons tahini
* 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, plus 1 teaspoon for garnish
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 1/4 cup water

## Directions

Heat the oven to 400Â° F.

On a baking sheet, toss the carrots and garlic cloves with 1 Tablespoon of oil and the cumin, salt and pepper. Roast until the carrots are tender and lightly caramelized, stirring halfway through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool until warm. Peel the garlic cloves.

In a food processor, combine the roasted carrots and garlic with the tahini, tarragon, lemon juice and water. Pulse until smooth. With the processor running, slowly add 2 to 3 Tablespoons of oil. Transfer to a serving bowl. Make a small well in the center of the hummus and fill with oil. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon of tarragon over the top.

## Ingredients

* 3 3-ounce packages raspberry-flavored gelatin
* 3 cups boiling water
* 1 16-ounce can whole cranberry sauce
* 1 20-ounce can crushed pineapple, undrained
* 1 cup finely chopped celery
* 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
* Whipped cream, for serving
* Celery leaves, for serving

## Directions

Grease a Bundt pan or large gelatin mold with cooking spray.

In a large bowl, combine the gelatin and boiling water, stirring well to completely dissolve the gelatin. Add the cranberry sauce, stirring until melted and incorporated. Let the mixture cool for 10 minutes.

Add the pineapple, celery, and pecans to the gelatin mixture and stir until well combined. Pour the mixture into the Bundt pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.

When ready to serve, remove the cranberry mold from the refrigerator. Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip the Bundt pan into the water, immersing it so that the water comes just up to- but not over - the edge for 15 seconds. Lift the mold from the water (if needed, wipe off any moisture on the pan with a tea towel). Place a serving plate upside down over the top, open side of the Bundt pan. Holding the pan and the plate together, invert both and shake the pan slightly to loosen the gelatin. Carefully pull the pan away. If necessary, repeat the warm-water dip. If the cranberry mold has softened, put the dish into the refrigerator for a few minutes to firm up.

Cut the cranberry mold into slices. Serve each piece with a dollop of whipped cream and a celery leaf.

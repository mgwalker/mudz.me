## Ingredients

* 2 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed
* 3 1/2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 1/4 cups milk
* 3 1/2 Tablespoons butter
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 2 -3 Tablespoons molasses (optional)

## Directions

Brush potatoes clean and place in a pot. Add enough water to just cover
the potatoes and cook until done. Pour off water and wait for the
moisture to evaporate. Once they feel dry, peel and mash hot potatoes.
Add flour, mix, and let the mixture stand in a warm place (around 120° F
- not a lot warmer than that or the process will be stopped) for 3-4
hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 300° F.

Melt butter. Heat milk. Add melted butter and warm milk into the potato
mixture, along with salt and nutmeg. Mix well. Taste the casserole and
if it\'s not as sweet as you would like, add molasses to taste and mix.
Pour into greased oven dishes. Only fill the dishes half full as the
casserole will bubble and rise a lot in the oven.

Drizzle some molasses on top of each casserole. Bake in the preheated
oven for 2-3 hours.

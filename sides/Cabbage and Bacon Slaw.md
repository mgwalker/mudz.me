title: Cabbage and Bacon Slaw
---

## Ingredients

* 6 cups cabbage, shredded or finely chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon celery seed
* pinch ground allspice
* 6 ounces bacon
* 1/2 medium yellow onion, finely diced
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 Tablespoons apple cider vinegar

## Directions

Place the shredded cabbage into a large bowl and toss with the salt, pepper, celery seed, and allspice.

Place the bacon in a skillet and cook on medium heat, turning once, until it’s just beginning to crisp about 7-10 minutes. Place the cooked bacon on a paper-towel-lined plate and leave the bacon grease in the skillet. You should have about 3 Tablespoons of bacon grease. (If you have significantly more, you can remove it and save it for another use. If less, make up the difference with olive oil.)

Keeping the skillet on the stove, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the onions. While occasionally stirring, cook until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat.

Pour the vinegar into the skillet and stir until it’s well combined with the onions and garlic. Transfer the cooked onions, garlic, and dressing to the bowl with the cabbage, scraping the skillet to get all the liquid and cooked bits. Finely chop the bacon and add it to the cabbage, too.

Toss everything until well combined, then taste and add more salt and pepper as needed, along with any other adjustments. Serve warm or at room temperature.

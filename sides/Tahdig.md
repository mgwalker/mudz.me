## Ingredients

* 8 cups water
* 2 Tablespoons salt
* 1 1/2 cups Basmati rice
* 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter

## Directions

In a large saucepan, combine the water and salt, and bring to a biol. Add the rice and boil for 10 minutes. Drain the rice through a colander and rinse under warm water.

Melt the butter in a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Spoon the rice over the butter, wrap a clean kitchen towel around the lid of the pan, and cover. Cook the rice over moderately low heat until it is tender and a crust forms on the bottom, 30 to 35 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to steam, covered, for another 5 minutes.

Gently spoon the loose rice onto a platter, then dip the bottom of the pan in a large bowl of cold water for 30 seconds to loosen the tahdig. Carefully emove the tahdig and place on top of the rice. Serve immediately.

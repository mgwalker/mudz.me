description: Persian crispy rice

## Ingredients

* 8 cups water
* 2 Tablespoons salt
* 1 1/2 cups basmati rice
* 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 pinch saffron threads
* 2 Tablespoons hot water

## Directions

In a large saucepan, combine the water and salt, and bring to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 10 minutes. Drain the rice through a colander and rinse under warm water.

Melt the butter in a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Spoon the rice over the butter, and use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke three holes through the rice down to the bottom of the pan. Wrap a clean kitchen towel around the lid of the pan, and cover. Cook the rice over moderately low heat until it is tender and a crust forms on the bottom, 30 to 35 minutes, shifting the pan around the burner occasionally to prevent burning.

While the rice is cooking, combine the saffron and hot water in a small bowl. Allow to steep for 10 minutes, then remove the lid from rice and quickly spoon the saffron and water over the top. Replace the lid and continue to cook.

Carefully dip the bottom of the pan into a bowl of cold water to loosen the tahdig. Cover with a plate and flip it over to turn out the rice. Serve immediately.

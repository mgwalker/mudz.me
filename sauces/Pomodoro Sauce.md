## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons  olive oil
* 4 - 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 - 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1/2 cup onion, minced
* 1 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 14.5-ounce can tomato puree
* 1 Tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon fish sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
* 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, shredded

## Directions

In a large saucepan over the lowest heat setting, add the olive oil, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes, and saut√© for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally so nothing burns but the flavor infuses in the oil. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the onions and a pinch of salt, and continue to stir and cook for an additional 3 - 4 minutes, or until the onions soften.

Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato puree, tomato paste, fish sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and allow the sauce to reach a simmer before reducing the heat to low. Stir in the basil, cover, and allow the sauce to continue simmering for 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt.

Serve over pasta or gnocchi.

---

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 3 cups thinly sliced onions
* 1 Tablespoon light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon garlic
* 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
* 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 Tablespoon cognac
* 1 cup brown chicken stock
* Salt and pepper

## Directions

In a small saucepan set over medium heat, add the butter. Once melted,
add the onions and sugar to the pan and sweat, stirring occasionally
until wilted and well caramelized, about 18 to 20 minutes. Add the
garlic and thyme to the pan and saut√© until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the flour to the pan and stir to make a roux, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Deglaze the pan with the cognac and once nearly evaporated, 1 minute,
add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer.
Simmer the gravy for 15 minutes and season with the salt and pepper.

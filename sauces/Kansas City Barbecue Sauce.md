title: Kansas City Barbecue Sauce
---

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1/2 cup finely diced onion
* 1 Tablespoon minced garlic
* 1/3 cup white vinegar
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 6 oz tomato paste
* 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 - 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
* 1/2 - 1 Tablespoon brown mustard
* 2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon liquid smoke

## Directions

Set a 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Once the
oil is hot, add the onions and garlic. Sweat the onions, stirring
occasionally, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vinegar and
cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the remaining
ingredients to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
simmer and cook until thickened. Remove from the heat and cool. Sauce
may be made up to 3 weeks in advance and refrigerated in a non-reactive
airtight container.

## Ingredients

* 3 Hatch or Anaheim chiles
* 2 jalape単os
* 2 plum tomatoes, cut in half, lengthwise
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, optional
* 1 Tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice, optional

## Directions

Turn on the broiler and place a rack 5 inches away from heating element.
Line a cast-iron skillet or baking sheet with foil and place the Hatch
chiles, jalape単os, tomatoes (seed side up), and garlic on the skillet.
Cook under the broiler for 7 minutes, and then remove the skillet from
the oven. The garlic should have light brown spots on it. Remove it from
the skillet and place in a blender. Turn over the Hatch chiles and
jalape単os (leaving the tomatoes as they are), and return the skillet to
the oven.

Continue to broil the chiles and tomatoes for 7 to 8 more minutes or
until nicely charred. After this time, remove the skillet from the oven.
Place the tomatoes in the blender, and put the Hatch chiles and
jalape単os in a paper sack or plastic food-storage bag, close it tight
and let the chiles steam for 20 minutes.

To capture any juices and other flavorful bits, add 1 cup of water into
the foil-lined skillet, swirl it around, and then pour it into a glass
measuring cup. The water should be a light brown color much like the
color of weak tea.

After the chiles have steamed, remove from the bag and rub off the skin.
Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and add them to the blender.
Add 1/4 cup of the skillet water to the blender and then pulse on low
until everything comes together. Depending on how thick you want it, add
more skillet water until it's your desired thickness. Stir in the salt,
taste, and make any adjustments.

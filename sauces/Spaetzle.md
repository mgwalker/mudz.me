## Ingredients

* 2 cups flour
* 3 eggs, room temperature
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon mace or nutmeg
* 1/3 - 1/2 cup club soda
* 1 Tablespoon melted butter, to serve

## Directions

Add the flour, salt, and mace to the bowl of a stand mixer and stir to combine. With the mixer set to medium-low speed, add the eggs and mix until well-combined. Slowly add the club soda and mix until the batter is smooth and shiny. Allow the batter to rest for 15 - 20 minutes.

Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Stir the batter once, then add 1/3 of the batter to a spaetzle maker. Press the batter through the spaetzle maker directly into the simmering water. Once the spaetzle float to the surface, allow them to cook for 2 - 3 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to remove them to a strainer. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Toss with the melted butter and serve.

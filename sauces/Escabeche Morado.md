## Ingredients

* 4 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3 - 4 cloves garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
* 5 cloves
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 bay leaves
* 5 red onions, thinly sliced
* 2 habanero chiles
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1/4 cup water
* sea salt

## Directions

Heat the olive oil in a pan. Add the garlic, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Add the red onions and chiles and cook for another 10 minutes. Pour in the vinegar, season to taste with salt, and, if the mixture is too thick, stir in water as needed. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool.

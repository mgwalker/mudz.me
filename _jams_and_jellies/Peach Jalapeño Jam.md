title: Peach Jalapeño Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pounds peaches
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 2 jalapeños, seeded and diced

## Directions

To peel the peaches, bring a pot of water to a boil. Cut an X at the top
and the base of the fruit and then boil the peaches for 1 minute. Remove
the peaches with a slotted spoon from the water and transfer to a bowl
filled with ice water to stop them from cooking. Once cool enough to
handle, gently rub off the skins. Cut into into 1/4-inch thick slices,
discarding the pit.

Toss the peach slices in a non-reactive saucepot with the sugar and
macerate for 1-2 hours or until the sugar has dissolved and the peaches
are soft and juicy. Meanwhile, sterilize the jars and lids in either a
pot of boiling water or the dishwasher.

Once the peaches have macerated, it's time to make the jam. First, place
a plate in the freezer. Then, stir in the lemon juice and the diced
jalapeño to the peaches. Place the saucepot on the stove and turn the
heat to high. Bring the pot to a boil and then turn the heat down to
low, stirring occasionally. (Don't worry if there's foam on top of the
jam. While some advise to skim it, I leave it and find it doesn't affect
the jam.)

After 40 minutes, take the plate out of the freezer and place a spoonful
of the jam on the plate. After a minute, tilt the plate and if the jam
doesn't run then it's ready. If it does run, continue to cook it while
occasionally stirring for 5 more minutes and then check again. Continue
to cook and test until it doesn't run.

Ladle into clean canning jars to within 1/8 inch of top. Wipe jar rims.
Set clean, flat lids on top. Screw on bands. Process in boiling water
for 5 minutes. Let cool at least 24 hours. Check seals by pressing
firmly on centers of the lids.

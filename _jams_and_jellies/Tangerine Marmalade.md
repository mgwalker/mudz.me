title: Tangerine Marmalade
---

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds tangerines, quartered
* 1 lemon, quartered
* 5 cups water
* 2 vanilla beans, split lengthwise and crosswise
* 3 1/2 cups sugar

## Directions

Cut tangerine and lemon wedges crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Discard seeds from fruit. Transfer fruit to large bowl. Add 5 cups
water, covering fruit. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let stand at room
temperature 1 day. Peel fruit, reserving peel. Scrape excess white from
peel. Cut enough of the peel into very thin strips. Transfer fruit
mixture and peel to heavy large pot. Scrape in seeds from vanilla beans;
add beans. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until rind is
very tender and fruit begins to fall from rind, stirring occasionally,
about 1 hour 15 minutes.

Remove from heat. Add sugar; stir until sugar dissolves. Boil gently
until mixture is 210Â°F, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 20 minutes.

Divide vanilla beans and boiling hot marmalade among four 1-cup jars.
Cover tightly and refrigerate up to 2 months.

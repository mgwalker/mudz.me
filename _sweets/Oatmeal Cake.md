## Ingredients


### Cake

* 1 cup quick-cooking oats
* 1 3/4 cups boiling water
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Topping

* 6 Tablespoons butter
* 1/4 evaporated milk
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup shredded coconut
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 cup chopped pecans

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Butter and flour a 9-inch by 13-inch baking
dish.

For the cake, place the oats and butter in a large heatproof bowl, and
pour over the boiling water. Cover with a plate or baking sheet, and
leave for 20 minutes. Beat in the sugar, brown sugar, and eggs.
Gradually beat in the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Pour the
batter into the prepared baking dish and bake for 35-45 minutes.

For the topping, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Add the evaporated
milk, sugar, coconut, vanilla, and pecans, and stir until mixed through.
Pour over the cake while still hot, adjust an oven rack to top of the
oven, and turn on the broiler. Broil until the topping is lightly
browned, then remove and leave to cool completely.

title: Limoncello Cheesecake with Almond Crust
---

## Ingredients


### Crust

* 1 cup slivered almonds, lightly toasted
* 2/3 cup graham cracker crumbs
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

### Filling

* 16 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1 1/4 cup sugar 
* 1 1/2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese (12 ounces)
* 1/2 cup Italian limoncello, at room temperature 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
* 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest, plus extra for serving (2 lemons) 
* 5 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 

## Directions

Heat oven to 350°F.

Tightly wrap the outside of a 9-inch diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 3 layers of heavy-duty foil. Finely grind the almonds, cracker crumbs, and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter and process until moist crumbs form. Press the almond mixture onto the bottom of the prepared pan (not on the sides of the pan). Bake the crust until it is set and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool. Decrease the oven temperature to 325°F.

Place the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the ricotta and beat for another minute, scraping down the bowl. With the mixer on low, add the limoncello, vanilla, and lemon zest and beat for one minute. With the mixer on medium-low, add the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl and mix until the batter is smooth. Pour over the crust. 

Place the springform pan in a roasting pan large enough to hold the baking pan completely flat. Place the pan in the oven and carefully pour enough of the hottest tap water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until almost set in the center. 

Turn off the heat and leave the cheesecake in the oven in the water bath for 15 minutes to prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Take the springform pan out of the water bath and place on a rack to cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least six hours before serving.

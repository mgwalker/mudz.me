## Ingredients

* 175 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
* 175 grams caster sugar
* 225 grams self-raising flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 3 medium eggs
* 1 teaspoon almond extract
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons cocoa powder
* 2 Tablespoons hot water

### Icing

* 25 grams unsalted butter
* 15 grams cocoa powder, sifted
* 2 Tablespoons milk
* 100 grams icing sugar
* 25 grams white chocolate

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Lightly grease a loaf pan and line the base of
the pan with a strip of baking parchment, letting it overhang at both
ends so you can pull the cake out after its baked.

To make the cake mixture, put the butter, sugar, flour, baking powder
and eggs in a bowl and beat until well combined. Transfer half the cake
mixture into a separate bowl. Stir the almond extract into the mixture
in one of the bowls. Mix the cocoa powder with the hot water to make a
paste, and add this to the other bowl and mix thoroughly.

Randomly spoon dollops of each mixture into the prepared tin until both
mixtures are finished. Smooth the top to make it level.

Bake in the oven for 50-60 minutes.

Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then
turn it out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.

For the icing, melt the butter in a small pan, then add the cocoa. Stir
and cook gently for 1 minute, then stir in the milk and the icing sugar
and take the pan off the heat. Leave the mixture to cool completely,
then spread it over the top of the cake.

Melt the white chocolate and dollop it on top of the icing. Run the tip
of a skewer through the dollops to give the icing a ripple effect and
leave it to set.

## Ingredients


### Crust

* 2 cups finely ground graham crackers (about 30 squares)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

### Filling

* 16 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 pint sour cream
* 1 lemon, zested
* 1 dash vanilla extract

## Directions

Heat the oven to 325Â° F.

In a mixing bowl, combine the graham crackers, cinnamon, and butter
until evenly moistened. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of an 8-inch
springform pan with non-stick cooking spray.

Pour the crumbs into the pan and, using the bottom of a measuring cup or
the smooth bottom of a glass, press the crumbs down into the base and
1-inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 5
minutes.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese on low speed for
1 minute until smooth and free of any lumps. Add the eggs, 1 at a time,
and continue to beat slowly until combined. Gradually add sugar and beat
until creamy, for 1 to 2 minutes.

Add sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Periodically scrape down the
sides of the bowl and the beaters. The batter should be well-mixed but
not over-beaten. Pour the filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth
the top with a spatula.

Set the cheesecake pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the
sides around it. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour
boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up
the sides of the cheesecake pan; the foil will keep the water from
seeping into the cheesecake. Bake for 45 minutes. The cheesecake should
still jiggle (it will firm up after chilling), so be careful not to
overcook. Let cool in pan for 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator,
loosely covered, for at least 4 hours. Loosen the cheesecake from the
sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim.
Unmold and transfer to a cake plate.

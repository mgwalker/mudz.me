---

## Ingredients

* 3 egg yolks
* 75g caster sugar
* 3 Tablespoons water
* 225g unsalted butter, cubed and softened
* 2 teaspoons vanilla

## Directions

Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a food mixer with the whisk attached.
In a pan over a gentle heat, dissolve the sugar in the water and then
boil it steadily until the syrup reaches 110° C (225° F) on a candy
thermometer. With the food mixer running, slowly pour the syrup over the
egg yolks. Continue whisking until the mixture is thick and mousse-like.
Add the butter, a little at a time, whisking continuously and finally
add the vanilla.

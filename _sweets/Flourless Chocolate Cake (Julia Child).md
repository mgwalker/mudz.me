title: Flourless Chocolate Cake (Julia Child)
---

## Ingredients


### Cake

* 1/4 cup strong brewed coffee or espresso, hot
* 7 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
* 2 ounces baker\'s chocolate
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 4 eggs, separated
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 3/4 cup sifted cornstarch

### Icing

* 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
* 1 ounces baker\'s chocolate
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Butter an 8-inch round cake pan

Add the coffee and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering
water. Stir until the chocolate is melted, then remove from the heat and 
stir in the butter. Set aside to cool slightly.

Beat together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and
lemon-colored. Gradually fold in the chocolate mixture to prevent the eggs
scrambling. 

Beat the egg whites until foamy, then add the cream of
tartar. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. 

Fold the cornstarch into the egg mixture 1/4 cup at a time, alternating with the
egg whites, until well combined.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Lift and drop the pan to
settle the batter. Bake 15-18 minutes, until the sides are just set and
center is still moist). Set aside to cool for about 10 minutes, then
unmold.

For the icing, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering
water. Remove from the heat, then mix in the butter. Spread over the
cooled cake and let stand until the chocolate is firm.

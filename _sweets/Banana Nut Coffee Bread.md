title: Banana Nut Coffee Bread
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 packed cup mashed ripe bananas
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup chopped pecans, walnuts, or macadamia nuts

## Directions

Heat the oven to 325Â° F and lightly grease a 10-inch round cake pan.

Cream the butter and sugar until well combined. Stir in the mashed
bananas, and then add the eggs and vanilla. Stir until well combined.

Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, espresso powder, and
salt and then add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Stir until
a sticky dark batter forms, then add the nuts.

Spoon the batter into the skillet, smoothing the top so it's even. Bake
uncovered for 45 minutes if using a skillet (or about 1 hour if using a
bread pan), or until an inserted knife comes out clean.

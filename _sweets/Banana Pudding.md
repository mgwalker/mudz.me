title: Banana Pudding

## Ingredients

### Custard
* 2 cups half and half
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 large egg yolks
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 4 overripe bananas
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
* Vanilla wafer cookies

### Whipped Cream
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2 Tablespoons powdered sugar

## Directions

To make the custard, mash the bananas in a medium bowl and stir in the lemon juice. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the half and half, sugar, flour, egg yolks, and salt, and then heat on medium-low heat, continuously stirring. After about 5-7 minutes, it will start to bubble and then thicken. Turn the heat down to low and stir in the bananas, butter, and vanilla. Turn off the heat.

To make the whipped cream, pour the cream into a mixing bowl and whisk on medium-high speed. Spoon in the powdered sugar and continue whisking until it makes soft peaks.

To assemble the banana pudding, spread a thin layer of custard in the bottom of an oval baking dish. Place a single layer of cookies on top, then evenly spread on half of the custard. Add another layer of cookies and the rest of the bananas, then top with the remaining custard. Spread the whipped cream over the top, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 4 hours.

title: Lemon Pastry Cream
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup (115 grams) sugar
* 1/4 cup (35 grams) corn starch
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 5 (95 grams) large egg yolks, cold
* 2 cups (455 grams) whole milk
* 1 Tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest
* 2 Tablespoons butter, cubed
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice

## Directions

In a large bowl, set up an ice bath by partially filling it with a combination of cold water and ice. Set aside.

In a medium heatproof mixing bowl set on top of a dampened towel, stir together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in the egg yolks until the mixture is pale yellow, smooth, and fluffy, about 1 minute.

In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and lemon zest. Bring to a bare simmer over medium heat. Remove the milk from the heat. While whisking continuously, slowly pour the milk into the egg yolk mixture in a thin stream until all of it has been added.

Return the mixture to the same saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly until the pastry cream begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Once it thickens, continue to whisk, pausing every few seconds to check for bubbles, about 1 minute. When it begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for 1 minute.

Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until thoroughly combined. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh strainer set over a medium heatproof bowl. Immediately place plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Transfer the bowl to the prepared ice bath to chill for 30 minutes, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.

When ready to use the pastry cream, add lemon juice and whisk until smooth.

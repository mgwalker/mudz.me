title: Bourbon Praline Pecans
---

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup butter, cubed
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
* 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1 cup pecan halves, toasted
* 1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
* 1 tablespoon bourbon

## Directions

Grease two baking sheets; set aside. In a large heavy saucepan over
medium heat, melt butter. Stir in the sugars, then cream; cook and stir
until mixture comes to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until a
candy thermometer reads 236Â° (soft-ball stage), about 20 minutes.

Remove from the heat; stir in the pecan halves, chopped pecans and
bourbon. Immediately drop by tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets.
Let stand until pralines are set and no longer glossy. Store in an
airtight container.

* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar

## Directions

Melt 1 1/2 cups of the butter in a pan and add the chopped pecans. Cook
the pecans in the butter for 4-5 minutes and set aside to cool.

Melt the remaining butter in a skillet over medium-low heat until golden
brown. Remove from the heat and pour into a a heat-proof bowl. Add in
the sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla, and mix well. Beat in the eggs one
at a time untiljust combined.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, corn starch, salt, cinnamon, and
baking soda. Gradually fold into the butter mixture until just combined.
Fold in the chopped pecans. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for
two hours.

Heat the oven to 375Â°F. Spoon large (3 Tablespoon) balls of dough onto a
lined baking sheet two inches apart. Press one pecan half into each
ball.

Bake until the edges are set and the center is still soft, about 9
minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes and sprinkle with
sugar.

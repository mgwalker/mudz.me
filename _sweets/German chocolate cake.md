title: German chocolate cake
---

## Ingredients

* 4 ounces German sweet chocolate
* 1/2 cup water
* 4 eggs, separated
* 2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup butter, softened
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 cup buttermilk

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and line each of three 9-inch round cake
pans with parchment paper. In a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering
water, melt the chocolate together with the water.

Beat the egg whites in small bowl until stiff peaks form, and set aside.
Beat the butter and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the
egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in the
melted chocolate and vanilla. Gradually add the flour, baking soda, and
salt alternately with the buttermilk, beating until well blended after
each addition. Gently fold in the egg whites, then pour the batter into
the prepared pans.

Bake for 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in centers comes out
clean. Immediately run a knife around edges of the pans. Leave the cakes
to cool completely.

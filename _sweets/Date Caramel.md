title: Date Caramel
---

## Ingredients

### Date Syrup
* 1 pound dried Medjool dates, pitted
* 4 cups water

### Caramel

* 270 grams date syrup
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 400 milliliters heavy cream

## Directions

Place a small plate in the freezer.

Chop the dates and place them in a medium saucepan along with the water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and cool for 30 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until very smooth, at least 1 minute.

Line a fine-mesh strainer with 2 layers of cheesecloth. Pour the date purée through. Once all the pulp is in the strainer, pull the sides of the cheesecloth together and twist to press out as much syrup as possible.

To thicken, return the syrup to a medium saucepan and simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.

Combine the date syrup, butter, and cream in a large saucepan and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring often, until smooth and bubbling, reaching 115-120° C. To test if it is ready, remove the plate from the freezer and put a teaspoonful of the sauce in the middle. Leave it for a minute then test the consistency - it should be spreadable and not runny. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool and thicken to a spreadable consistency.

title: Lemon Poundcake
---

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup honey
* 3 eggs, room temperature
* 1/3 cup lemon juice
* zest of 1 lemon
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 cup Greek yogurt or sour cream
* 1/2 cup buttermilk, milk, or cream

### Glaze

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 Tablespoon butter, melted 

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F and lower the rack to the lower third of the oven. Grease a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy; about 2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl as needed. With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time. Then add the honey, milk or cream, lemon juice, and lemon zest; beat on medium speed until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

With the mixer running on low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients just until combined. If needed, run a whisk through the batter a few times to rid any large lumps. Avoid over-mixing.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Gently tap the pan on a countertop to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack.

While the cake is baking, make the glaze. Combine the lemon juice, melted butter, and confectioners’ sugar. Add additional water or confectioners’ sugar to achieve desired glazing consistency.

Once the cake is cool, drizzle the glaze over the top and leave to harden slightly before slicing and serving.

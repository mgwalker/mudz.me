title: Oatmeal Crust
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1/3 cup flour
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 5 Tablespoons butter

## Directions

Heat the oven 375Â° F.

Combine the oats, flour, sugar and salt. Using a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. Press it firmly on the bottom and sides of lightly greased 9-inch pie plate.

Bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned. If the crust has slid at all, as the crust cools slightly, gently push the crust back up the sides of the pie plate. Cool completely and fill as desired.

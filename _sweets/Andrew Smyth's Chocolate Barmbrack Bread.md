## Ingredients


### Bread

* 300 grams bread flour, plus extra for dusting
* 2 1/2 Tablespoons ground mixed spice
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 8 grams fast-action yeast
* 33 grams unsalted butter, softened
* 66 grams golden caster sugar
* 200 milliliters 2% milk
* 1 egg
* 100 grams mixed dried fruit
* 30 grams mixed candied peel
* 100 grams Belgian milk chocolate chips
* 1 Tablespoon sunflower oil, for greasing

### Topping

* 1 Tablespoon caster sugar
* 50 milliliters boiling water
* 50 grams dark chocolate, finely chopped
* 50 grams white chocolate, finely chopped

## Directions

For the bread, line a baking tray with baking paper and dust generously
with flour.

Sift the flour, mixed spice and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the
yeast on the opposite side to the salt. Add the butter and sugar. Mix
using your hand in a claw position until well combined.

Gently warm the milk until it is warm to touch, then whisk in the egg.

Make a well in the middle of the dry mixture and pour the milk mixture
into it. Dust your hands with flour and mix using your hand as before,
until the dough comes together. It will form a very wet dough. Knead the
dough for 10-15 minutes in the bowl (use a dough scraper if you have
one), or until the dough starts to tighten (though it will still be
sticky). Regularly scrape off any dough stuck to your hands.

Flour the work surface and your hands. Spread the dough out in a rough
rectangle and add the dried fruit, candied peel and chocolate into the
middle of the dough. Knead for a further 2 minutes to incorporate.

Place the dough on the prepared tray and shape into an oval. Lightly
dust with flour and cover with oiled cling film. Leave in a warm place
to prove for an hour or until doubled in size.

Heat the oven to 380Â°F.

Once the dough is proved, remove the cling film and slash once
lengthways across the top with a sharp knife. Bake for 40 minutes on the
bottom shelf of the oven, rotating the tray midway through cooking to
ensure you get an even crust (the loaf should be a dark-brown color). If
the bottom edges brown too early, wrap a strip of aluminum foil around
the loaf.

Just before the loaf is cooked, make the glaze. Mix the sugar with the
boiling water in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved.

Place the loaf on a wire rack and, while it is is still hot, liberally
brush the glaze all over the crust.

To decorate, gently melt the dark chocolate in a microwave or
bain-marie. Allow to cool for 5 minutes then drizzle liberally over the
loaf. Repeat with the white chocolate.

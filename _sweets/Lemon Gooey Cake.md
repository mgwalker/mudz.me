title: Lemon Gooey Cake
---

## Ingredients

* 2 1⁄4 cups flour
* 2 1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1⁄2 teaspoon salt
* 1 3-ounce package lemon-flavored gelatin
* 3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 Tablespoon lemon zest
* 1 1⁄2 cups sugar
* 3 large eggs, room temperature
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/4 cup lemon juice

### Glaze

* 1/3 cup lemon juice
* 2 cups powdered sugar

## Directions

Heat oven to 350° F. Butter and flour a 9-inch by 13-inch cake pan.

In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and gelatin.

Cream the butter, zest, and sugar until soft and light, about 2 minutes. Add the
eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the lemon juice.

Add the dry ingredients to the batter, alternating with the milk, until smooth. Pour into the
prepared baking dish, smoothing the surface.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden on top and springy to the touch.

While the cake is baking, combine the the powdered sugar and lemon juice
in a bowl. While the cake is still hot, use a fork to poke holes in the
cake. Pour the glaze over the cake and let sit until cool.

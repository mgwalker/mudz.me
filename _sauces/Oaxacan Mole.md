* 1/3 ripe banana
* 1/4 cup (about 1.5 ounces) finely chopped Mexican or dark chocolate

## Directions

De-stem the chiles, tear them open and scrape out the seeds, collecting
them. Put seeds into an ungreased skillet with the torn-up tortilla, set
over medium-high heat, turn on an exhaust fan, and toast until
thoroughly burned to charcoal black, about 15 minutes. Scrape them into
a fine-mesh strainer and rinse for 30 seconds, then transfer to a
blender.

Set an ungreased skillet over medium heat, lay on a piece of aluminum
foil, and lay the onion slices and garlic cloves on that. Roast until
soft and very dark (about 5 minutes on each side of the onion slices;
about 15 minutes for the garlic). Cool the garlic a bit, peel it, then
reserve both.

While the onion/garlic are roasting, turn on the oven to 350Â°F. Return
the skillet to medium-high heat, add the lard or oil (to 1/2-inch
depth), and, when hot, begin frying the chiles a couple at a time: After
about 30 seconds, turning once, remove to drain on paper towels. Put
them in a large bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for 30 minutes.
Drain, reserving the soaking liquid.

While the chiles are soaking, toast the seeds and nuts. Spread the
sesame seeds onto a baking sheet or ovenproof skillet, spread the
pecans, peanuts and almonds onto another baking sheet or skillet, then
set both into the oven. Toast about 15 minutes until all take on a dark
hue. Reserve a few sesame seeds for garnish, then add the rest of the
seeds and nuts to the blender with 1 cup chicken broth. Blend until
smooth, and put in a bowl.

Without rinsing the blender, combine the tomatoes, tomatillos & 1/4 cup
broth. Puree and put in another bowl. Again, w/o rinsing, put onion,
garlic, toasted bread, cloves, pepper, cinnamon, oregano, thyme, banana
and 1/2 cup broth. Puree and put in a separate bowl. Put half the chiles
and 1/2 cup broth, puree and put in fourth bowl. Repeat with other half
and add to a fourth bowl.

In a large dutch oven, heat 3 Tablespoons of oil (use the oil in which
you fried the chiles) over medium-high heat. Add the tomato puree and
cook until thick and dark (the color of cinnamon), about 20 minutes. Add
the nut puree and cook for 7-8 minutes, until the color of olive or
anchovy paste. Add the banana-spice puree and do the same, cooking
another 7-8 minutes, until it\'s the color it was before adding the
latest puree. Finally, add the chile puree, turn heat to medium low and
simmer for about 30 minutes until very thick and
black.

Stir in the remaining 3 1/2 cups broth and the chocolate, partially
cover and simmer gently for an hour stirring often. Season with salt and
sugar, taste and adjust as needed. Nestle the thigh/leg pieces in the
sauce, partially cover and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add the breast
pieces, cover completely, and cook an additional 25 minutes until
chicken is cooked through. Pull out the chicken pieces and put on a
plate or serving platter. Spoon sauce over the chicken and garnish with
sesame seeds. Serve with rice.

title: Chai Syrup
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1 star anise
* 4 cloves
* 4 cardamom
* 8 black peppercorn
* 2 Tablespoons fresh ginger, sliced
* 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

Crush the spices into large pieces using a pestle and mortar. In a pan over medium-low heat, dry roast the spices for about 45 seconds. Be careful not to toast or burn the spices. Remove from heat.

Combine the sugar, brown sugar, water, and sliced ginger to the spices in the saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sugar should be completely dissolved. The longer the spices steep in the syrup, the stronger the chai flavoring will be.

Remove from heat, cool the syrup, stir in vanilla extract and strain the syrup. Pour into sterile containers and store in the refrigerator.

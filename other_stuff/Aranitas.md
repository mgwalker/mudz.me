## Ingredients

* 4 garlic cloves
* 3 green plantains, peeled and grated on the large holes of a box grater
* Pinch kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves
* Vegetable oil, for frying

## Directions

Heat 2-inches of oil to 350 degrees F in a heavy skillet or deep pot over medium-high heat. Line a plate with paper towels and set aside.

While the oil warms, place the garlic cloves on a cutting board. Slice the cloves in half lengthwise and then smash with the side of a chef's knife. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the garlic and chop and smear the garlic against the cutting board until it makes a paste.

Place the grated plantains, garlic paste, and pepper in a large bowl and mix until combined. Using 2 Tablespoons, scoop out some of the mixture and press it flat with the back of the other spoon.

Gently slide the fritters into the hot oil, adding enough to fill the pan without overcrowding it. Fry until golden, for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fritters to the lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with some more salt and the cilantro, and serve warm.

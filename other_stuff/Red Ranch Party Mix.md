---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups woven cereal, such as Chex
* 1/2 cup roasted pecans
* 1/2 cup roasted almonds
* 1/2 cup roasted cashews
* 1/2 cup roasted peanuts
* 1 cup pretzel sticks
* 1 cup square cheese crackers
* 1/2 cup sunflower oil
* 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 1.5-ounce ranch dressing packet
* 1 Tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons dried dill weed
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
* Pinch cayenne
* Salt

## Directions

Heat the oven to 250° F. Line a 9-inch by 13-inch pan with parchment paper. (If it’s nonstick, you can skip this step.)

Add the cereal, pecans, almonds, cashews, peanuts, pretzel sticks, and cheese crackers to the pan. Stir everything until the ingredients are well combined. Pour the oil and Worcestershire sauce evenly over the mix. Sprinkle the ranch dressing, chili powder, dill weed, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and cayenne evenly over the mix. Stir until everything is well coated and blended. Taste and adjust seasonings and add salt if desired.

Bake uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring once. Cool then serve. Will keep covered for a week.

title: Fried Chickpeas
---

## Ingredients

* 2/3 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 6 Tablespoons olive oil

## Directions

Add the chickpeas and their soaking water to a pot and add enough water to cover the chickpeas by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the chickpeas are cooked through, 1 - 2 hours.

Drain and rinse the chickpeas, then spread them on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Use more paper towels to pat them dry.

Heat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add half the chickpeas to the oil and fry, stirring frequently, until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chickpeas to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat for the remaining chickpeas.

Add the drained chickpeas to the bowl with the seasonings, and toss to coat.

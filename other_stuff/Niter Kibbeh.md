## Ingredients

* 250 grams unsalted butter
* 1/2 teaspoon nigella seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds (korarima)
* 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon dried koseret
* 1/2 teaspoon dried besobela

## Directions

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, skimming off the foam. Cook for about 5 minutes until the solid, milky residue has sunk to the bottom, but do not let the solids darken. Remove from the heat and allow to cool a little, then strain the liquid into a clean saucepan and discard the solids.

Add the nigella, cardamom, and coriander seeds to the pan and cook over a low heat for 5 - 10 minutes until aromatic, stirring gently from time to time. Add the koseret and besobela, and continue to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring gently. Watch that it does not burn or that the oil darkens.

Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Strain through a cheesecloth into a clean, airtight container. Once completely cool, cover and store in the refrigerator.

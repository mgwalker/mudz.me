## Ingredients

* 4 cups whole milk
* 1 Tablespoon salt
* 1/4 cup white vinegar

## Directions

Add the milk and salt to a medium pot and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Once boiling, stir in the vinegar until the milk solids separate from the liquid. Strain through cheesecloth set in a mesh sieve or colander, and wrap the ends of the cheesecloth over the top. In the refrigerator, place the the sieve or colander over a bowl, and place a weight on top of the cheese. Leave to drain at least an hour, or overnight for a firmer cheese.

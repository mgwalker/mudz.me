## Ingredients

* 2 plums, chopped
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 cup honey

## Directions

In a medium sauce pan, combine the water and the sliced plums. Bring to a light simmer until the plums begin to split and release their juices. Add in the honey, and gently stir to combine.

Remove from the heat, and allow to cool. Strain out the plum solids and store the syrup in a glass jar in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds chicken
* 2 Tablespoons teriyaki marinade
* 2 Tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 Tablespoon fish sauce
* 1 Tablespoon oyster sauce
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* Pinch of black pepper

## Directions

In a nonreactive bowl, add the teriyaki, soy, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and black pepper, and stir to combine. Add the chicken, toss to coat, cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours.

Heat the oven to 375Â° F.

Place the chicken on a lightly-greased baking tray, and bake until cooked through, 20-30 minutes. Leave to rest for 5 minutes, then slice. Serve with stir-fried noodles and vegetables.

title: Indian Fried Chicken

## Ingredients


### Marinade

* 1 cup plain yogurt
* 2 Tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 Tablespoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
* 3 pounds chicken parts

### Batter

* 3/4 cup chick pea flour
* 1/4 cup corn starch
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne

## Directions

To make the marinade, in a non-reactive large bowl, stir together the
yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, kosher salt, garam masala, ginger,
turmeric, and cayenne. Place the chicken in the bowl and toss to coat,
working the marinade under the skin. Store covered in the refrigerator
for 2-12 hours.

After the chicken has marinated, line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
To make the batter, whisk together the chick pea flour, corn starch,
garam masala, salt and cayenne until well combined. Place on a plate.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, dredge each piece into the flour
until well coated, and place the flour-coated chicken pieces on the
sheet. (They can be close together, but should not overlap.) Allow the
flour-coated chicken pieces to rest unrefrigerated for 1 hour. This step
will help the coating adhere better when the chicken fries. Discard the
marinade.

To fry the chicken, line a sheet pan with paper towels. On medium-high,
heat to 350° F 1/2-inch of vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet,
preferably cast iron. Working in batches, place the chicken pieces in
the oil, skin side down, turn down the heat to medium, cover the skillet
and cook for 7 to 8 minutes.

Take off the cover, gently turn over the chicken with tongs or a wooden
spoon, and continue to cook uncovered for 7 to 8 more minutes. Stick an
instant read thermometer in the largest piece, and check that it's 150°
F so, place the fried chicken the paper towels to drain. If not,
continue to cook for a couple more minutes. Repeat for the remaining
pieces, using the same oil.

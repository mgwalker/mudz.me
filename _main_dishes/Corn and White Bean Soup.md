title: Corn and White Bean Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon olive oil
* 3 ounces pancetta, cubed
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 yellow onion, diced
* 2 cups frozen corn
* 1 Tablespoon oregano
* 2 cups cooked white beans
* 2 cups bean broth
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Flat-leaf parsley, minced

## Directions

In a soup pot, warm the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the pancetta
cubes and saute over medium-low heat until tender and chewy, about 10
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent them from burning.

Add the garlic and onion and saut√© until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the
corn, oregano, beans, and broth, stirring to mix all of the ingredients.
Raise the heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring occasionally,
until the corn is tender and the flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper. Serve in bowls, garnished with parsley.

title: Coca-Cola Braised Carnitas
---

## Ingredients

* 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 Tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Pinch ground allspice
* 5 cloves garlic, smashed
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cup Mexican Coca-Cola
* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1/4 cup whole milk
* 2 Tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
* Water
* Warm tortillas, for serving
* Guacamole, for serving
* Sour cream, for serving

## Directions

Place the pork in a Dutch oven, then season with the salt and pepper.
Pour in the Mexican Coca-Cola, orange juice, milk, and lime juice then
stir in the chipotle chile powder, cinnamon, allspice, garlic and bay
leaf. Add enough water to the pot to just reach the top of the pork,
then turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a
boil.

Once the pot is at a boil, turn the heat down to low and then simmer
uncovered without stirring for about 2 hours, or until the pork is
tender. At this time, turn the heat up to medium and then while
occasionally stirring, cook until most of the liquid has reduced, most
of the fat has rendered, and the pork has browned, about 30-45
minutes.

Remove from the pot and serve warm with tortillas, guacamole, and sour
cream.

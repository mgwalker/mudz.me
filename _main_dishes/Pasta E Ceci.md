## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup dried chickpeas
* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, minced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 cup diced canned tomatoes
* 1 cup soup shell pasta
* 4 cups kale, chopped
* Parmesan or grana padano cheese, grated

## Directions

Add the chickpeas to a saucepan and add enough water to cover by two inches. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until done, 2 - 3 hours. Remove from the heat, but do not drain.

Heat the oil in a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not taking on any color, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary and red-pepper flakes, and cook 1 minute more. Season well with salt and pepper.

Drain the chickpeas, reserving the broth. Stir in the tomatoes and the chickpeas, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon or spatula and smashing about 1/2 cup of the beans.

Add 3 cups of the chickpea broth and bring to a boil over high. Add the pasta and simmer, stirring often to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan, until the pasta is al dente, according to package directions. The broth will mostly be absorbed by the pasta, but if you prefer it brothier, you can add 1/2 to 1 cup of broth and simmer until warmed through, 1 minute more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add the kale and stir until wilted. Stir in the grated cheese, to taste. Taste and adjust seasonings accordingly.

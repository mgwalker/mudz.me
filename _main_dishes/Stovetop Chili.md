## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef chuck
* 2 15-ounce cans chili beans, drained
* 1 14-ounce can diced tomatoes with juice
* 6 ounces tomato paste
* 1/2 large yellow onion, chopped
* 2 green chili peppers, seeded and chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cubes beef bouillon
* 1/2 cup beer
* 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
* 2 Tablespoons chili powder
* 1/2 Tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon white sugar

## Directions

Heat a pot over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground chuck into the hot
pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.

Add the onion, chili peppers, and garlic, and saut√© until onions soften.
Pour in the chili beans, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, bouillon, and
beer, stirring until the tomato paste has dissolved. Season with chili
powder, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil,
salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and
simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

After 2 hours, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder if
necessary. The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste.
Remove from heat and serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.

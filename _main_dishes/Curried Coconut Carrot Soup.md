title: Curried Coconut Carrot Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons coconut oil
* 8 medium carrots, unpeeled and roughly chopped
* 1 large onion, roughly chopped
* 3 1/2 cups vegetable stock
* 15 ounces coconut milk
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons grated ginger
* 1 Tablespoon curry powder
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Heat the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion. Sweat the onions until soft, about 7 minutes. Add the carrots and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, stir to combine, cover, and cook until the carrots are soft, 10 - 15 minutes.

When the carrots are soft, blend the soup until smooth, return to the pot, and cook to the desired consistency. Season to taste.

## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons oil
* 1 medium onion, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon ground fenugreek
* 1 Tablespoon garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 teaspoons grated ginger
* 1 Tablespoon berbere
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 1 Tablespoon honey
* 1 pound ground beef
* 2 Tablespoons niter kibbeh, or clarified butter
* 1 teaspoon ground negella seeds
* 2 Tablespoons chickpea flour
* 1/2 cup hot water
* 1/4 teaspoon mekelesha

## Directions

Whisk together the white wine and the honey.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan over-low heat, add the oil, onion, and fenugreek, and cook, stirring frequently, for 8 - 10 minutes until soft and golden. 
Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for about a minute, until aromatic. Stir in the berbere and 1/4 cup of the wine, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, 
stirring frequently. Add water as needed to prevent scorching.

Add the ground beef, niter kibbeh, and ground nigella, season generously with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is 
browned, abut 5 minutes. Add the remaining wine and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes.

Whisk the chickpea flour into the hot water until smooth, then stir it into the pot. Partially cover the pot with a lid and cook over low heat, stirring 
frequently for about 20 minutes. Add water as necessary to keep it from drying out.

Stir in the mekelesha, cook for another 3 - 4 minutes, and serve with cooked lentils.

title: Char Siu Pork
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound pork butt, cut into 4 pieces
* 3 clove garlic, finely chopped
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons cooking oil

### Char Siu sauce

* 1 1/2 Tablespoons maltose ([麦芽糖 - ]{.s2}màiyátánɡ[)]{.s2}
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons honey
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 Tablespoon Chinese rose wine ([玫瑰露酒 - ]{.s2}méiɡui lùjiǔ)
* 3 dashes white pepper powder
* 1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

## Directions

Add all ingredients in the char siu sauce in a sauce pan, heat it up and
stir-well until all blended and become slightly thickened and sticky. (It will
yield 1/2 cup char siu sauce.) Transfer out and let cool.

Marinate the pork butt pieces with 2/3 of the char siu sauce and the
chopped garlic overnight. Add 1 1/2 Tablespoons cooking oil into the
remaining char siu sauce. Keep in the fridge.

The next day, heat the oven to 375° F and roast the char siu for 15
minutes (shake off the excess char siu sauce before roasting). Transfer
them out of the oven and thread the char siu pieces on metal skewers and
grill them over fire (I used my stove top). Brush the remaining char siu
sauce while grilling until the char siu are perfectly charred. Slice the
char siu into bite-size pieces, drizzle the remaining char siu sauce
over and serve immediately with steamed white rice.

[Cook's Notes]{.s1}

You don't have to roast the pork in the oven if you use an outdoor
grill. As I used the stove top to char the char siu, I roasted the char
siu in the oven so they were cooked. It's impossible to cook the char
siu by using the stove top alone. You can roast the char siu thoroughly
for 25-30 minutes in the oven. It's best to use the S-shape hook and
hang your char siu at the top layer of the oven, with a roasting pan or
aluminum foil sheet at the bottom for the drips.

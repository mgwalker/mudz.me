## Ingredients

### Marinade

* 2 pounds chicken pieces
* 2 cups buttermilk
* 2 teaspoons hot sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

### Breading

* 2 cups flour
* 1/4 cup paprika
* 3 Tablespoons white pepper
* 2 Tablespoons garlic salt
* 1 Tablespoon black pepper
* 1 Tablespoon celery salt
* 1 Tablespoon powdered mustard
* 1 Tablespoon ground ginger
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons MSG
* 1 1/2 teaspoons basil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme
* 1 teaspoon oregano

## Directions

Combine the buttermilk, hot sauce, and salt in a large plastic bag and shake to combine. Add the chicken and shake to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.

Set the chicken on the counter for 1 hour to come up to room temperature.

Heat the oven to 175° F. Heat a large pot of oil to 350° F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.

Combine all the breading ingredients in a large bowl. Once the oil is hot, dredge the chicken pieces in the breading and drop into the oil in batches. Fry the chicken for 12 minutes, then remove it to the baking sheet and place in the oven while the next batch fries. When all the chicken is fried, return the baking sheet to the oven for 20 minutes.

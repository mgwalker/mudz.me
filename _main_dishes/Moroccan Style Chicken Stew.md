---

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs chicken, cubed
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 large onions, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 Tablespoon ginger
* 2 Tablespoons ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads (or ground turmeric)
* 1 pound tomatoes, diced
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 cup black olives, chopped
* 1 cup raisins
* 1/2 cup apricots, diced
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 2 teaspoons corn starch
* 1/2 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped

## Directions

Heat oil in a large braising pan. Season the chicken with salt and
pepper, and add to the oil. When browned on all sides, add the onions
and sauté for 1 minute. Add the garlic, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add
ginger, cumin, and cinnamon. Cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, about 5 minutes.

Whisk the cornstarch into the chicken broth, then add to the pan along
with the tomatoes, lemon juice, red pepper, and saffron. Bring to a boil
and add the olives, apricots, and raisins. Reduce heat and simmer about
15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Garnish with parsley and serve over
couscous.

title: Tuscan Pork and White Beans
---

## Ingredients

* extra virgin olive oil
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 carrot, diced
* 2 stalks of celery, diced
* 2 cloves of garlic, chopped
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon of dried chili flakes
* 2 fresh bay leaves
* 4 thyme sprigs
* 8 sage leaves
* 2 1/2 cups water
* 1 cup white wine
* 1 Tablespoon tomato paste
* 12 ounces dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight in cold water
* 2 pounds pork neck, cut into three large pieces
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Zest and juice of one lemon

## Directions

Heat the oven to 325Â° F.

In a large oven-proof pot, heat a good lug of olive oil over a low
flame. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, fennel seeds, herbs, and
chili and cook gently until soft and translucent. Cook these aromatics
extremely low and slow for around 10-15 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and white wine and stir to combine. Add the
cannellini beans and water. Increase heat and bring to the boil. Add the
pork, ensuring it is immersed in the beans and liquid and season with
salt and pepper. Cover pot with a lid and cook in the preheated oven for
3- 3 1/2 hours - checking every hour or so for water levels. You may
need to add more to ensure the beans continue cooking and the pork does
not dry out. The beans should be tender and the pork falling apart.

Scatter over the zest of the lemon and squeeze of the juice to taste.
Serve immediately with crusty bread.

title: Chicken Fajitas
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound chicken, cut into thin strips
* 1/2 red bell pepper, julienned
* 1/2 medium yellow onion, sliced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1/3 cup water
* 2 Tablespoons fajita seasoning
* Lime

## Directions

Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add
the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently,
until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink. Remove the chicken
to a bowl, reserving any liquids in the pan. Add the remaining
Tablespoon of oil to the pan, along with the garlic, onion, and pepper.
Let the vegetables sit in the hot oil for 30-45 seconds to get a light
char. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the pepper and onion
are soft. Add the chicken back to the pan, along with the water and
fajita seasoning. Stir to coat. Add a squeeze of lime, and cook until
the water has reduced, 1-2 minutes.

Serve in warm tortillas with desired toppings.

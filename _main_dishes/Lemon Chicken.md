title: Lemon Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* ½ tablespoon soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon Shaoxing wine, optional
* 1 tablespoon corn starch
* 10 oz (300g) skinless, boneless chicken breast/thigh, cut into small
* pieces
* ¼ cup corn starch plus ¼ cup all-purpose flour, sifted and combined well
* Oil, for deep-frying

### Sauce

* 3 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 5 tablespoons water
* 1 teaspoon corn starch
* Pinch of salt, or to taste

## Directions

Mix together soy, rice wine, and cornstarch. Add chicken and toss until
coated. Set aside at least 30 minutes. Mix all the ingredients for the
sauce and set aside.

Coat the marinated chicken with the corn starch and all-purpose flour
mixture. Heat up a wok with about two inches of oil. As soon as the oil
is fully heated, deep-fry the chicken until golden brown. Transfer the
chicken out to a dish lined with paper towels to sock up the excess oil.

Add all the ingredients in the sauce into a small sauce pan and bring it
to a quick boil. Transfer the fried chicken into the sauce, stir to coat
well with the lemon sauce. Serve over rice.

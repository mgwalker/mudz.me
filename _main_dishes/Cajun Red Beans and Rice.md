title: Cajun Red Beans and Rice
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound dry red beans
* 1 Tablespoon oil
* 3/4 pound Andouille sausage, sliced
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 rib celery, diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, ground
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
* 1 1/2 teaspoons brown mustard
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 cup rice, cooked

## Directions

Pour the beans into a large bowl, cover with an inch of water, and leave
to soak overnight.

In a large pot, such as an enameled cast iron dutch oven, heat the oil
over medium heat and brown the sausage slices, stirring occasionally,
about 6 minutes. Remove and reserve the sausage. Add the onion, garlic,
bell pepper, and celery and saut√© until soft, stirring occasionally,
about 10 minutes.

Add the beans, bay leaves, thyme, cayenne, and enough water to cover by
about 2 inches. Bring to a strong boil and continue boiling for 15
minutes. Reduce heat to medium low, so that the beans are cooking with a
gentle simmer.

Once the beans have started to soften but not cooked fully, just over an
hour, add the reserved sausage to the beans along with the mustard.
Continue to cook until the beans are soft, another 1 - 2 hours. Add more water
as needed. Continue cooking until the liquid is more like a thick gravy
than a thin soup. Stir in the cooked rice and serve.

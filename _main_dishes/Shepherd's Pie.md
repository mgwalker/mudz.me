## Ingredients


### Potatoes

* 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes
* 1/4 cup half-and-half or milk
* 2 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 egg yolk

### Filling

* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 2 carrots, peeled and diced small
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb or beef
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons tomato paste
* 1 cup beef stock
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon rosemary leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon thyme leaves
* 1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
* 1/2 cup fresh or frozen English peas

## Directions

Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan
and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a
boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and
cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 20
minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the
saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt
and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until
well combined.

Preheat the oven to 400°F.

While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Pour the canola oil
into a 12-inch sauté pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil
shimmers, add the onion and carrots and sauté just until they begin to
take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to
combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked
through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and
toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato
paste, beef stock, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to
12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.

Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into a large
glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the
edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and
smooth with a rubber spatula. Place on a sheet pan on the middle rack of
the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to
brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.

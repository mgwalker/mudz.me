## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 large yellow onions, sliced
* 3-4 Tablespoons oil
* 2 pounds skinless chicken drumsticks or thighs
* 2 bay leaves
* 8 ounces walnut halves (about 2 cups)
* 1/4 cup cold water
* 1 cup pomegranate molasses
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Toast the walnuts in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and
lightly browned. Spread onto a baking sheet and leave to cool. Once
cool, place the walnuts in a blender and pulse until finely ground. Add
the water and stir until combined into a thick paste.

Fry the sliced onions with the oil in a large pot until golden brown.
Season the chicken on each side with salt and pepper and add the
chicken to the pot. Spoon the walnut paste evenly over the chicken. Add
the pomegranate molasses and stir to combine. Add the bay leaves, and
bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce to medium-low heat, cover, and
cook for 15 minutes.

Stir, then reduce the heat to low and simmer covered for an additional 1
hour and 15 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and the chicken is
fork tender and falls off the bone. Stir every 15 minutes or so to make
sure the sauce does not stick to the pot.

Serve over rice.

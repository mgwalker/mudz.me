## Ingredients


### Pie Crust

* 2 cups flour
* 1/3 cup water
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 cup butter, cut into cubes

### Filling

* 2-3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 onion, diced
* 1/4 pound carrots, cut into 1/2-inch half moons
* 2 celery ribs, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch thick pieces
* 1 sprig thyme
* 1 sprig rosemary
* 2 sage leaves
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 quart chicken broth
* 1 stewed chicken, meat removed and cubed
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 ounces flour
* 1-2 Tablespoons poultry seasoning
* 6 ounces frozen baby peas

## Directions

Dissolve the sugar and salt in the water, then place in the refrigerator
to chill. Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender. Gradually
add the water and work until a dough is formed. Divide the dough into
halves, cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes.

In a large stockpot, sauté the onions in the olive oil until
translucent. Add in the celery and carrots, and cook until fragrant. Add
the herbs and chicken broth and bring just to a boil. Reduce to a simmer
until the vegetables are tender. Remove the herbs and strain, reserving
the broth. In another saucepan, melt the butter, then whisk in the
flour. When smooth, whisk in the strained broth and simmer until thick. Season with salt and pepper, as
desired. Add the gravy to the vegetables, then add the peas, chicken,
and poultry seasoning. Stir to combine. Cook another 4-5 minutes, then
remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Roll out the dough into sheets 1/4-inch thick. Carefully transfer one
sheet to the bottom of a baking dish.

Pour the filling into the unbaked pie crust. Cover with the second
crust, sealing the edges and cutting slits to allow steam to escape.
Bake at 400° F until the crust is golden brown.

title: Marsala Braised Beef & Tortellini
---

## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1-2 pound boneless beef short rib (or similar tough cut of beef)
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 tomato, diced
* 6 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
* 8 ounces marsala wine
* 2 teaspoons dried basil
* 2 teaspoons dried thyme
* black pepper
* 1-2 pounds cheese tortellini, boiled

## Directions

Season sthe hort ribs with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon basil, and a couple
dashes of black pepper. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Take the short
ribs out of the refrigerator an hour before cooking, to come to room
temperature. After 30 minutes, season them generously on all sides with
salt.

Heat oven to 325° F.

Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat, then add the ribs. Sear the meat on all sides until
browned. (Do not crowd the meat.) When the ribs are browned, transfer them to a plate to rest.

Sauté the onions and mushrooms in the pan drippings until the onions just begin to brown. Add the garlic and cook about 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the
tomato, wine, remaining herbs, and ribs. Salt and pepper to taste. Bring just to a boil and transfer the pan into the oven and braise 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until the meat is tender. Serve over pasta.

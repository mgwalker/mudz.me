## Ingredients

### Chicken

* 3 Tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons olive oil 
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika 
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 
* 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric 
* 3 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1 pound chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces 
* Salt and pepper, to taste

### Yellow Rice

* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1 Tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
* 1/2 small onion, minced 
* 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric  
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
* 3/4 teaspoon salt  
* 3/4 cup chicken stock
* 1 cup water

### White Sauce

* 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise 
* 1 Tablespoon white vinegar 
* 1 teaspoon sugar 
* 2 cloves garlic, minced 

## Directions

Put the lemon juice, olive oil, paprika, cumin, coriander, allspice, turmeric, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the chicken and give it a good stir to make sure all the pieces are coated with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, refrigerated, for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.

While the chicken is marinating, make the yellow rice. Heat the olive oil in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté, stirring occasionally, until translucent and a bit golden, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, turmeric, cumin and salt and stir to combine. Add the chicken broth and water and turn the heat to medium high.  

Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat to medium. Cover the pan and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit for 5 minutes so it can finish steaming.

Combine all the ingredients for the white sauce in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

To cook the chicken, adjust an oven rack to the top of the oven and heat the broiler on high. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease it with some olive oil. Spread the chicken into a single layer on the baking sheet. Broil for 8 minutes, then carefully drain off any excess liquid from the pan. Return the chicken to the oven and cook until golden brown and slightly crispy at the edges, another 5 - 8 minutes. Remove the oven and serve hot with pitas, yellow rice, tomatoes, lettuce, and white sauce.

## Ingredients

* 3 pounds of pork butt, with plenty of fat
* 1 cup of orange juice
* 3 cups of water
* 2 teaspoons of salt

## Directions

Cut pork into strips (three inches by one inch), add to a large pot with
the liquids and salt. Bring to a boil and then simmer uncovered on low
for 2 hours. Do not touch the meat.

After two hours, turn heat up to medium high, and continue to cook until
all the liquid has evaporated and the pork fat has rendered (about 45
minutes). Stir a few times, to keep pork from sticking to bottom of pan.

When pork has browned on both sides, it's ready (there will be liquid
fat in the pan). Serve either cubed or shredded (pork will be tender
enough that just touching it will cause it to fall apart).

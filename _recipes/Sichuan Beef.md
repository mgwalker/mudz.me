---

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons oil
* 8 oz beef, cut into thin strips
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 small green bell pepper, cut into long strips
* 1/4 small red bell pepper, cut into long trips
* 1-2 baby carrots, cut into matchstick strips
* 1/2 teaspoon chili oil (bottled chili oil), optional
* 2 stalks scallions, cut into 2-inch strips

### Marinade

* 1 teaspoon cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine)
* 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce

### Sauce

* 1 1/2 heaping teaspoons oyster sauce
* 1 1/2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce
* 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1/2 teaspoon chili oil
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

## Directions

Marinate the beef with all the ingredients in the Marinade, for 15
minutes.

Combine all the ingredients in the Sauce, stir and mix well, set aside.

Heat up a wok and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is fully heated,
add the beef and do a few quick stirs, until the surface turns opaque
and slightly charred. Transfer out and set aside.

Clean the wok and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is
fully heated, add the garlic and stir-fry until aromatic. Add all the
peppers and carrots and stir a few times before adding the beef back
into the wok. Add the Sauce and stir to combine well. Stir in the
scallion and chili oil, dish out and serve immediately with steamed
rice.

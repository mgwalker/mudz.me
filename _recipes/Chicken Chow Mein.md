title: Chicken Chow Mein
---

## Ingredients

* 1 chicken breast, thinly sliced
* 1 teaspoon Chinese five spice
* 1 Tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1 Tablespoon chili sauce
* 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
* 3-4 green onions, sliced into rings
* 6 ounces chow mein noodles
* 1-2 Tablespoons peanut oil
* sesame oil

## Directions

Mix together the five spice, soy, and chili sauce. Add the chicken, stir
to coat, and set aside 15-30 minutes.

Boil the pasta according to package directions. Immediately rinse with
cold water and toss with sesame oil, to prevent sticking.

Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the
oil shimmers, add the chicken and let sit 15-20 seconds without
stirring. Stir fry until just cooked through, then add the bell pepper.
Cook until the pepper turns soft, 2-3 minutes. Add the noodles and toss.
Sprinkle with soy sauce and stir fry another minute. Add the green
onions and stir through. Remove from heat and serve.

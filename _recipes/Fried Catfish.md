## Ingredients

* 1 pound catfish fillets, cut into inch-wide strips
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 cup yellow cornmeal
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* Oil for frying

## Directions

Salt and pepper the fillets with half the salt and pepper. Put the
cornmeal on a plate and stir in the remaining salt and pepper. Beat the
eggs and milk together in a bowl. Dip the fillets in egg-milk mixture
and then dredge in cornmeal, covering both sides.

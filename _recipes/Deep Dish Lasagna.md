## Ingredients

* 12 uncooked lasagna noodles
* 3 cups shredded mozzarella

### Tomato sauce

* 1 pound sweet Italian sausage
* 3 pounds tomatoes, crushed
* 2/3 cup onion, minced
* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 Tablespoon oregano
* 1/2 Tablespoon basil
* 1/2 Tablespoon Italian seasoning
* 1/3 cup fresh parsley, chopped
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 cup water
* splash of red wine

### Ricotta filling

* 1 pound part-skim ricotta cheese
* 10 ounces chopped spinach
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 3 eggs
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â° F.

In a bowl, combine the ricotta filling ingredients and mix well.
Refrigerate.

In a skillet over medium heat, brown the sausage with the onions and
garlic. Add the remaining sauce ingredients, heat to a boil, and reduce
heat to low. Simmer 2-3 hours until reduced, stirring occasionally.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook 8-10
minutes until al dente. Drain.

In a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish, spread 2 cups of tomato
sauce. Layer with noodles, ricotta filling, tomato sauce, and
mozzarella, repeating until all the ingredients are used up.

Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional
10 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.

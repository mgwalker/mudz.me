title: Flautas

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds of chuck roast, cut into four-inch chunks
* 1 tablespoon fat: lard, bacon grease or canola oil
* 1 medium Spanish onion, quartered
* 5 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 2-4 jalapeños, diced
* 1 pound tomatillos, quartered
* 2 tablespoons cumin
* Salt and black pepper to taste
* Juice of one lime
* 12 corn tortillas
* About 1 cup of canola oil

## Directions

Brown the cubed beef in the fat on medium heat in a large Dutch oven or
pot (may have to do in batches). Add the onions, garlic, tomatillos,
jalapeños, cumin, four cups of water (or beer if you prefer), salt and
pepper to taste.

Bring to a boil and then lower to a simmer and cook for two hours until
meat is tender. Remove beef from the pot, shred it and then toss it with
the lime juice and some salt and black pepper. Can also add some of the
pan juices if you like. Otherwise, you can reserve the pan juices for
another use.

Wrap the tortillas in foil, and heat in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes
or until soft. Take each warmed tortilla and place two tablespoons of
the shredded beef into it and roll tightly.

Heat the canola oil in a large iron skillet and when oil is 350 degrees
(or hot but not smoking), gently place three flautas into oil, seam side
down, and cook on each side until crisp, 45 seconds per side.

Serve immediately.

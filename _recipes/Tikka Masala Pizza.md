## Directions

Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large bowl. Mix with
hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. The bowl should be
at least 4 to 6 times to volume of the dough to account for rising.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are
well-sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up
to 24. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.

Meanwhile, prepare the chicken. Combine the marinade ingredients and the
chicken in a medium bowl and refrigerate at least one hour, or
overnight.

[Once the dough has risen, s]{.s2}prinkle the top lightly with flour,
then transfer it to a well-floured work surface. Divide dough into two
pieces and form each into a ball by holding it with well-floured hands
and tucking the dough underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a
tight ball.

Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil in the bottom of two 10-inch cast iron
skillets or round cake pans. Place 1 ball of dough in each pan and turn
to coat evenly with oil. Using a flat palm, press the dough around the
pan, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom
and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough
sit at room temperature for two hours.

[Meanwhile, cook the chicken. ]{.s3}Set the oven to broil on high.
Spread the chicken on a foil-lined baking tray, and cook 7-8 minutes.
Drain as much liquid from the pan as you dare, then return the chicken
to the oven and cook until slightly charred, about 7 minutes. Remove
from the oven and set aside. Turns off the broiler, and set the oven to
bake at 475°F.

Prepare the sauce. Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium
heat. Add the garlic and the chile; cook one minute, stirring
constantly. Add in the coriander, cumin, paprika, garam masala, and
salt. Stir fry 30 seconds, until fragrant. Stir in the tomato sauce and
simmer until thick, about 15 minutes. Add the cream and simmer another 5
minutes.

[Par-cook the dough. ]{.s2}After two hours, dough should be mostly
filling in the pan up to the edges. Use your fingertips to press it
around until it fills in every corner, popping any large bubbles that
appear. Lift up one edge of the dough to let any air bubbles underneath
escape and repeat, moving around the dough until there are no air
bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the pan.
Place in the oven and cook for 10 minutes.

Remove the pans from the oven and carefully assemble the pizza. Return
the pans to the oven and bake until the cheese is lightly browned, 5-7
minutes. Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving.

title: Lobster Stock
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup olive oil
* Shells from 5 cooked lobsters, rinsed
* 1 onion, roughly chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 10 peppercorns

## Directions

In a large stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the lobster
shells and saut√© for 1 minute. Add enough water so that the pot is 2/3
full, then add the onion, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to a boil,
then reduce heat to low and simmer for several hours or overnight. (The
longer it simmers, the better.) Using tongs, remove and discard the
large shells, then strain the stock through a fine sieve twice.

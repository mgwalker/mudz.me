title: Chicken Cordon Bleu
---

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces Swiss cheese
* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 16 slices ham
* 1 Tablespoon parsley
* 1 cup flour
* 3 eggs, room temperature
* 2 Tablespoons milk
* 2 cups panko (or breadcrumbs)
* Salt and pepper
* oil for frying

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

Place chicken breast flat on a cutting board and, using a sharp knife,
cut a deep pocket horizontally into the center of the meat about 3/4 of
the way down on the thickest side, being careful not to cut all the way
through. Season the inside of the meat with salt and pepper.

Cut the cheese into strips and wrap in the ham. Insert the ham and
cheese sticks into the chicken breasts.

In a bowl, beat together the eggs and the milk. Dredge the stuffed
chicken breasts in the flour, then the eggs, and then in the panko.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken
and cook until golden brown on all sides. Place the chicken in a baking
dish, and bake until cooked through.

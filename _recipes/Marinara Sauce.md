title: Marinara Sauce
---

## Ingredients

* 1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 7 garlic cloves, peeled and slivered
* Small dried whole chili, or pinch crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 large fresh basil sprig, or 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, more to taste

## Directions

Pour tomatoes into a large bowl and crush with your hands. Pour 1/4 cup
water into can and slosh it around to get tomato juices. Reserve.

In a large skillet (do not use a deep pot) over medium heat, heat the
oil. When it is hot, add garlic.

As soon as garlic is sizzling (do not let it brown), add the tomatoes,
then the reserved tomato water. Add whole chili or red pepper flakes,
oregano (if using) and salt. Stir.

Place basil sprig, including stem, on the surface (like a flower). Let
it wilt, then submerge in sauce. Simmer sauce until thickened and oil on
surface is a deep orange, about 15 minutes. (If using oregano, taste
sauce after 10 minutes of simmering, adding more salt and oregano as
needed.) Discard basil and chili (if using).

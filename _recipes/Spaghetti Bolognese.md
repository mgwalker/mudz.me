## NOTE:
fennel

1 large carrot, cut into 1/2-inch dice

2 ribs celery, cut into 1-inch dice

2 cloves garlic

Extra-virgin olive oil, for the pan

Kosher salt

1 pound ground chuck, brisket, or round, or combination

1 cup tomato paste

1 1/2 cups hearty red wine

Water

3 bay leaves

1 bunch thyme, tied in a bundle

1 pound spaghetti or fettuccine

1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

## Directions

In a food processor, puree onion, carrot, celery, and garlic into a
coarse paste. In a large pan over medium heat, coat pan with oil. Add
the pureed veggies and season generously with salt. Bring the pan to a
medium-high heat and cook until all the water has evaporated and they
become nice and brown, stirring frequently, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the ground beef and season again generously with salt. Cook another
15 to 20 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and cook until brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the
red wine. Cook until the wine has reduced by half, another 4 to 5
minutes.

Add water to the pan until the water is about 1 inch above the meat.
Toss in the bay leaves and the bundle of thyme and stir to combine
everything. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, stirring
occasionally. As the water evaporates you will gradually need to add
more, about 1 to 2 cups at a time. Stir and taste frequently, adjusting
salt as necessary. Simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

During the last 30 minutes of cooking, bring a large pot of water to a
boil over high heat to cook the spaghetti. Season generously with salt.
When the water is at a rolling boil add the spaghetti and cook for 1
minute less than it calls for on the package. Reserve 1/2 cup of the
pasta cooking water.

Drain the pasta and add to the pot with the ragu. Stir or toss the pasta
to coat with the sauce. Add the reserved pasta cooking water and cook
the pasta and sauce together over a medium heat until the water has
reduced. Turn off the heat and give a big sprinkle of Parmigiano. Toss
or stir vigorously. Divide the pasta and sauce into serving bowls or 1
big pasta bowl. Top with remaining grated Parmigiano. Serve immediately.

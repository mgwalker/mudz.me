title: Carrot Casserole
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup short grain rice
* 3/4 cup water
* 1 1/2 whole milk
* 1 pound carrots
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3 1/2 Tablespoons dark molasses
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 cup cream

## Directions

Bring the water to the boil in a thick-bottomed saucepan. Add the rice
and cook, stirring, until water is wholly absorbed in it. Add the milk
and bring the mixture to the boil again, stirring frequently. Lower the
heat to minimum, cover the pan with lid and simmer until the rice and
milk have thickened into a soft-textured, velvety smooth porridge. Stir
every now and then to prevent the porridge from burning on the bottom or
forming a skin on the surface.

Meanwhile, peel the carrots and cut off their ends. Cut the carrots in
about 2-inch long chunks. If they are very thick, halve them lengthwise.
Cook the carrots in boiling water until tender. Pour out the cooking
water. Place the uncovered pan back to the warm stove plate, so that the
excess moisture will evaporate, and the carrots feel dry. Puree the
carrots through a food mill.

Mix the carrot puree in the rice porridge and let the mixture cool a
bit. Add the salt, molasses, eggs and half of the cream. Whip the rest
of the cream and gently fold it in. Pour the batter into one or two
buttered oven casseroles.

Sprinkle the surface with a thin layer of dry breadcrumbs and decorate
it by pressing little bumps on it with the tip of a spoon. Dot the
surface with pats of butter.

Bake the casserole either at 350° F for 1 - 1½ hours until the batter is
set and cooked, slightly puffed and golden brown on top.

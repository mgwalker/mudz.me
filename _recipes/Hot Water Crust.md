title: Hot Water Crust
---

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup bread flour
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup water
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup lard

## Directions

Mix the dry ingredients together in a large heat-proof bowl. In a
saucepan, combine the water, butter, and lard, and heat until the fat is
melted. Pour the hot liquid into the bowl with the flour and stir until
well combined. Turn out the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and
knead until smooth.

Divide the dough, setting aside 1/3 for the top crust. Roll out the
dough between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper, to 1/4-inch
thick. Line an 8-inch springform pan with the crust, and fill with
prepared filling. Roll out the top crust and place on top. Pinch the
seams to seal, and use the handle of a wooden spoon to create a hole in
the center of the top crust.

Bake at 375Â° F until golden and crispy, 45-75 minutes.

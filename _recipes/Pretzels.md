title: Pretzels
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup warm water
* 1 Tablespoon yeast
* 2 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 Tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 3 1/2 cups flour
* 5 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 egg, beaten
* Kosher salt

## Directions

Add the water, yeast, sugar, brown sugar, salt, and flour to a large
bowl. Mix until the dough comes to together and pulls away from the
sides of the bowl. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 2
minutes.

Form the dough into a ball and pull into 12 equal portions. Roll each
portion into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape. Place on lined
baking sheets, cover with plastic wrap, and leave to rise for 30
minutes.

Heat the oven to 475Â° F.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda. In
batches, add the pretzels and boil for 1 minute. Transfer back to the
baking sheets, brush with the egg, sprinkle with salt, and bake until
golden brown, about 10 minutes.

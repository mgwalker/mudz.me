## Ingredients


### Marinade

* 1 cup plain yogurt
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons ground red pepper
* 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 Tablespoon minced ginger
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed

### Sauce

* 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 jalape√±o chile, minced
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 8-ounce can tomato sauce
* 1 cup cream

## Directions

Combine the marinade ingredients and refrigerate at least one hour, or
overnight.

Set the oven to broil. Spread the chicken on a foil-lined baking tray,
and broil the chicken 7-8 minutes on each side, or until the ends become
slightly charred. Remove from the oven.

Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the
garlic and the chile; cook one minute, stirring constantly. Add in the
coriander, cumin, paprika, garam masala, and salt. Stir fry 30 seconds,
until fragrant. Stir in the tomato sauce and simmer until thick, about
15 minutes. Add the cream and simmer another 5 minutes.

Add the grilled chicken to the sauce and simmer until heated through.
Serve over basmati rice or naan.

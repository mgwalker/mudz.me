title: Cheese and Herb Souffle
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup milk
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 small onion, peeled
* pinch paprika
* grated Parmesan cheese, for dusting the dish
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons butter
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons flour
* 3 eggs, separated plus 1 egg white
* 3 ounces cheese, grated or mashed
* 1 generous Tablespoon chopped fresh herbs
* salt and pepper
* 1 sprig rosemary, cut in 3

## Directions

Put the milk with the bay leaf, onion, and pinch of paprika in a
saucepan and bring just to the boil. Turn off the heat, cover, and set
aside to infuse 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaf.

Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter 8 (1/2-cup) ramekins or 1 (4-cup)
souffle dish, and dust with the grated Parmesan cheese.

In a clean saucepan, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour and cook 1
minute. Gradually whisk over the milk, and cook, stirring, until thick,
about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and beat in the yolks. Stir
through the cheese and herbs. Season well with salt and pepper.

Beat the whites to stiff peaks with a pinch of salt. Stir a spoonful
into the yolk mixture, then pour the yolk mixture onto the remaining
whites and gently fold together. Pour into the souffle dish and bake
until risen and set, but still slightly creamy in the center, about 30
minutes, depending on the size of the souffle dishes. Serve immediately
before it slumps.

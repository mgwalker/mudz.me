## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces
* 2 1/2 Tablespoons butter, ghee or oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 2-inch cinnamon stick, lightly bruised
* 2 cardamon pods
* 2 cloves
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 black peppercorns, lightly crushed
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic

### Marinade

* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons chili powder or paprika
* 1 1/2 cups plain yogurt, lightly whipped
* 2/3 cup fried onions, lightly crushed (or 1 Tablespoon onion powder)

## Directions

Marinate chicken with marinade ingredients for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Heat up wok with the butter and add the whole spices, stirring until
fragrant. Add the garlic and the ginger and cook another 30 seconds.
Toss in the chicken with the marinade and continue to stir-fry for 10
minutes.

Turn heat to medium-low, cover the wok and cook for 30 minutes, or until
the oil slightly separates, chicken is tender enough, and you have
achieved the gravy consistency that you prefer.

Salt to taste, and add some water if the dish appears to be too dry.
Dish out and serve with basmati rice or naan.

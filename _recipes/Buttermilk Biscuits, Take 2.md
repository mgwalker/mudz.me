title: Buttermilk Biscuits, Take 2
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups flour[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 Tablespoon baking powder[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 teaspoon sugar (can add more to taste)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 8 Tablespoons butter, chilled
* 3/4 cup buttermilk

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 450°F.

Mix all the dry ingredients together. Cut the stick of butter into
pieces, and work into the flour mixture with your hands or a pastry
blender until it resembles pea-sized crumbs. Add the liquid, mixing
until a bit loose and sticky.

Pour dough out on a floured surface, and knead for a minute. Dough
should be smooth and no longer wet. You can sprinkle more flour on the
surface if you find it's sticking. Take dough into a ball, and hit it
with a rolling pin, turning it and folding it in half every few whacks.
Do this for a couple of minutes.

Roll out dough until it's 1/4 of an inch thick, and then fold it in
half. Using a round cutter cut out your biscuits from folded dough.
Place on a greased baking sheet close together (so they rise up not
out), and bake for 15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.

Makes 10-12 biscuits.

title: Tandoori Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound chicken legs
* Oil, for basting
* 1 lime, cut into wedges

### Marinade

* 1/2 cup yogurt
* 1 teaspoon finely minced ginger
* 1 teaspoon finely minced garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 2 Tablespoons lime juice
* 1 Tablespoon oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt or to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder

## Directions

Clean and pat dry the chicken with paper towels.

Mix all the ingredients of the Marinade in a bowl. Stir to combine well.
Add the chicken to the Marinade and marinate for at least 2 hours, or
best 4 hours.

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil and
place a wire rack over it. Place the chicken on the wire rack. Bake for
20 minutes, then turn the chicken over and bake for another 20 minutes.
Using a small brush, baste both surfaces of the chicken with the oil a
couple of times during baking. Broil the chicken for 1 minute or until
the skin is slightly charred. Remove from the oven and serve
immediately.

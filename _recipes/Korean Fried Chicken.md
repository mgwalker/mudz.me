title: Korean Fried Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken, cut into halves lengthwise
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 small onion, cut into chunks
* cooking oil for frying

### Batter

* 1/4 cup potato starch
* 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 Tablespoons roasted soybean powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes
* pinch of black pepper
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup icy cold water

## Directions

With a sharp kitchen knife or scissors, snip the flesh between the thigh
and the body and around the wing of each chicken half. Evenly season
with salt and pepper. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours or overnight. But if you
are busy you can go next step right away. Evenly coat with flour.

Combine the batter ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk or mix well with a
spoon until there are no lumps.

Heat 2 inches of cooking oil in a fry pan or pot until it reaches 350ยบ
F. Add the onion chunks and fry until brown. Remove the onion with tongs
or skimmer.

Whisk the batter again so it's well-mixed and then and dip one chicken
half so it's evenly coated. Lift the chicken and let the batter drip
off, then put it into the hot oil. Let cook for 2 minutes and then turn
it over with tongs. Fry for another 10 minutes, turning over
occasionally. Take it out and put it on a wire mesh strainer over a
stainless steel bowl. Repeat with the other chicken half.

Heat up the oil again to 350ยบ F and add a chicken half. When the oil
starts bubbling vigorously, grab the chicken with your tongs in one
hand, and with your kitchen scissors in the other hand cut some slashes
into the thick thigh and breast. Fry the chicken 10 to 11 more minutes,
turning over occasionally. Take it out and put it in a mesh strainer
lined with paper towels, and fry the other chicken half.

Serve immediately with pickled radish.

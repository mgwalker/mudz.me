title: Chicken Fried Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup buttermilk
* oil for frying

## Directions

Pound the breasts until they are 1/4-inch thick.

Mix together the flour with the salt, black pepper, and cayenne and
place on a plate. Whisk together the eggs with the buttermilk. Lightly
sprinkle the breasts with salt and pepper then dredge each into the
flour. Dip the flour-coated breasts into the eggs and then dredge in the
flour again. Place the breaded chicken breasts on a sheet
pan.

Heat up the oven to 200°F. In a large heavy skillet, such as a cast-iron
skillet, on medium-high heat up an inch of oil to 350°F, about 5
minutes. If you don't have a thermometer, you can test the temperature
by sticking a wooden spoon into the oil. If it bubbles around the spoon,
it should be ready for frying.

Working in batches, gently lower each breast into the oil and cook for 2
minutes per side, or until lightly browned, turning once. Drain on a
paper towel and place in the oven while you fry the remaining breasts.

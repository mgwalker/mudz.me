## Directions

Season short ribs with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon basil, and a couple
dashes of black pepper. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Take the short
ribs out of the refrigerator an hour before cooking, to come to room
temperature. After 30 minutes, season them generously on all sides with
salt.

Heat oven to 325° F.

Heat a large Dutch oven over high heat for three minutes. Add olive and
let heat 1-2 minutes, then add ribs. Sear meat on all sides until
browned. (Do not crowd the meat.) When ribs are browned, transfer them
to a plate to rest.

Sauté onions and mushrooms in pan drippings until onions just begin to
brown. Add garlic and cook about one minute, stirring frequently. Add
tomato, wine, remaining herbs, and ribs. Salt and pepper to taste. Add
cream to desired consistency. Bring just to a boil and transfer pan into
preheated oven and braise 2 ½ - 3 hours, or until meat is tender. Serve
over pasta.

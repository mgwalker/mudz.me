---

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
* 2 Tablespoons light soy sauce
* 2 Tablespoons clear honey
* 1/4 cup orange juice
* pinch ground white pepper
* 2 beef filet steaks[Â ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 Tablespoon groundnut oil
* 3 1/2 oz fresh shiitake mushrooms, sliced

## Directions

Place the rice wine, soy sauce, honey, orange juice and ground white
pepper into a large bowl and whisk well to combine. Add the beef steaks,
cover and refrigerate 10-15 minutes.

Heat peanut oil in wok until hot. Add beef, reserving marinade. Cook 2-3
minutes on each side (for medium). Add some of reserved marinade. Cook
until both sides of beef are glazed and sauce is sticky. Remove from
heat and cover with foil. Leave to rest 5 minutes.

Add remaining marinade to wok. When sticky (\~30 seconds), add
mushrooms. Cook 3-4 minutes until softened, adding water to help steam
mushrooms. Remove from heat and add to plate with beef.

Serve with salad greens and orange segments.

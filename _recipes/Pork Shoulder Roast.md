---

## Ingredients

### Pork
* 1 Tablespoon ground fennel seed
* 3 Tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves
* 8 cloves garlic
* 2 Tablespoons fresh lemon zest
* 2 whole dried chiles
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground sage
* 1 Tablespoon kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 4 pounds pork Shoulder

### Pan Sauce
* 1 shallot, minced
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* 1/2 cup white wine
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

In a food processor, combine the fennel seed, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, dried chiles, paprika, sage, salt, pepper, and oil. Pulse until blended, then rub over the pork shoulder. Wrap the pork in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Coat a roasting pan with olive oil. Remove the pork from the refrigerator, place in the roasting pan, and leave to come up to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 450° F.

Place the pork in the oven for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 325° F. Cook another 1 1/2 - 2 hours, until the internal temperature reaches 145° F. Remove from the oven, remove to a cutting board, and allow to rest for 20 minutes.

While the pork is resting, make the pan sauce. Pour the juices left in the roasting pan into a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until they turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and white wine, and cook until it reduces to a sauce consistency, 5 - 10 minutes.

Slice the pork into thin pieces and spoon the sauce over the top.

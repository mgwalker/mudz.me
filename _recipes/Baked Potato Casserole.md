---

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
* 1/2 heaping teaspoon sugar
* 3 heavy dashes ground black pepper
* 2 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and cut into pieces
* 8 oz boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
* 2 slices Canadian bacon, cut into pieces
* 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
* 1 heaping cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 1 stalk scallion, green part only, cut into small rounds

## Directions

Heat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9″ x 9″ baking pan with some oil or
butter.

Add the salt, sugar, and pepper to the heavy cream. Lightly stir to
combine well.

Spread the potatoes, follow by the chicken, in one single layer.
Sprinkle the bacon, butter, and then top with half of the cheddar cheese
and the scallions. Pour the heavy cream over top of casserole. Cover
with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour. Uncover the pan and bake for
another 30 minutes. In the last 10 minutes, sprinkle with the remaining
cheddar cheese and bake until the cheese is slightly crusty. Remove from
the oven and serve immediately.

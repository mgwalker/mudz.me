title: Balsamic Chicken Wings
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/2 cup honey[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/2 cup brown sugar[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/4 cup soy sauce[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 5 sprigs of rosemary[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 5 garlic cloves, halved[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 10 to 12 chicken drumsticks[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 2 Tablespoons toasted sesame seeds[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Directions

Combine the balsamic, honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, rosemary sprigs,
and garlic cloves, in a large, re-sealable plastic bag. Shake and
squeeze the contents of the bag to dissolve the honey and the brown
sugar. Add the chicken drumsticks to the bag and seal with as little air
as possible in the bag. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 2
hours.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Place the chicken drumsticks on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until
the skin is caramelized and very dark in spots, about 30 to 35
minutes.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Meanwhile, place the marinade in a small saucepan. Bring the marinade to
a boil (in order to kill bacteria). Reduce the heat to simmer and cook
over low heat until thick, about 15 minutes.
Reserve.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Use a pastry brush to brush some of the cooked marinade on the cooked
chicken. Place the chicken on a serving platter. Sprinkle with the
sesame seeds and the chopped parsley.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Cook\'s note: I like the rosemary and garlic flavors in the background.
Brushing the cooked drumsticks with the reduced marinade helps the
flavors along. Also, re-moistening helps the parsley and the seeds to
adhere.

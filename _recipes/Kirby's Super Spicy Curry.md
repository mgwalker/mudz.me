## Ingredients

* 1/2 red apple
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon ginger
* 3/4 cup water
* 1 teaspoon medium curry powder
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon Chinese five spice
* 1 teaspoon red pepper
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 dried birds eye chillies, crushed
* Salt
* 2 cups tomatoes, chopped
* 3 teaspoons olive oil
* Vegetables and meat of your choice

## Directions

Roughly chop the onion, garlic, ginger and apple and place in a pot.
Pour the water over the ingredients, bring to the boil, cover and simmer
for 20-30 minutes.

Once the water has reduced, add 1 teaspoon of each of the spices and
crush the dried chillies. Add the tinned tomatoes and salt to taste,
then simmer for another 10 minutes. Add the olive oil then blend with a
hand blender.

Chop the vegetables and meat, and add them to the curry base. Cover and
simmer until they are cooked (you may need to add more water). Serve
over rice.

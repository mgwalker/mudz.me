## Ingredients

* 1 3/4 cups lukewarm milk
* 3 Tablespoons softened butter
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 2 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* 4 1/2 cups bread flour
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* Cornmeal, for dusting

## Directions

Combine all of the ingredients except the cornmeal in the bowl of a
stand mixer. Beat the dough at medium-high speed using the flat beater
paddle until it starts coming away from the sides of the bowl, and is
satin-smooth and shiny, about 5 minutes. Scrape the dough into a rough
ball, and cover the bowl. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, 1 -
2 hours.

Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 16 pieces. Shape each piece
into a smooth ball. Dust a flat surface with cornmeal, then flatten the
balls until they\'re about 3 - 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Place the
flattened dough on a baking sheet and cover with a clean cloth for 20
minutes.

Heat a griddle over low heat.

Cook the muffins over low heat for 7 to 15 minutes per side, until their
crust is golden brown, and their interior is cooked through. When done,
the center of a muffin should register about 200Â°F on an instant-read
thermometer. Set aside to cool.

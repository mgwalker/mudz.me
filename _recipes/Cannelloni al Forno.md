## Directions

[Tomato Sauce]{.s1}

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the
onion and garlic and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to
10 minutes. Add the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more, until the
carrot is quite soft. Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil,
stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick
as hot cereal. Season with salt.

[Pasta]{.s1}

Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the
olive oil. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to
incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the
mound to retain the well shape. The dough will come together when half
of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.
Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and
scrape up and discard any leftover bits. Lightly reflour the board and
continue kneading for 6 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a
little sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30
minutes at room temperature.

[Filling]{.s1}

In a large skillet, heat the butter over high heat until it foams and
subsides. Add the ground pork and veal and cook over high heat until it
begins to brown in its own fat. Drain the excess fat and add the
Parmesan, the flour and the milk and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for
10 minutes, stirring regularly, then remove from heat and allow to cool.
Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and stir in the egg. Set aside.

[Bechamel]{.s1}

In a medium saucepan, heat butter until melted. Add flour and stir until
smooth. Over medium heat, cook until light golden brown, about 6 to 7
minutes.

Meanwhile, heat milk in separate pan until just about to boil. Add milk
to butter mixture 1 cup at a time, whisking continuously until very
smooth and bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes and remove from heat. Season
with salt and nutmeg and set aside.

[Cannelloni]{.s1}

Roll the pasta out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine
and cut it into rectangles measuring 4 inches by 6 inches. Divide the
meat filling evenly among the rectangles and roll the pasta around the
filling, jelly-roll style making 14 to 16 cannelloni. Blanch until
tender in boiling water. Remove and put in an ice water bath. In an 8 or
9-inch square, oven-proof casserole, spoon half the tomato sauce across
the bottom in an even layer. Carefully lay each pasta package in the
casserole so that they are in a single layer. Top with the remaining
tomato sauce, then the cheese sauce. Finish with the freshly grated
Parmesan and bake in the oven 20 to 25 minutes, until the sauces and
cheese are bubbling and the edges of the pasta are crispy and browned.
Serve immediately from the cooking dish.

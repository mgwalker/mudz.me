title: Oven Fries
---

## Ingredients

* 2 russet potatoes, cut in 1/2 lengthwise, halves cut lengthwise into
* fourths to make 16 big, fat wedges
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 Tablespoons chopped parsley leaves
* 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 425Â° F.

Preheat a baking sheet in the hot oven for at least 5 minutes.

While the baking sheet is heating, toss the potatoes with the olive oil
and salt in a large bowl. Then dump the potatoes out onto a baking
sheet, spreading to a single layer. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, shaking
the pan every now and then, until the potatoes are cooked through, brown
and crispy. Toss the fries in a big bowl with the parsley and cheese.

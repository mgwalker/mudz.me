title: Tarragon Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 Tablespoon olive oil
* 1 chicken (about 3 pounds), cut into 8 pieces
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup chicken stock
* 3/4 cup dry white wine
* 1 shallot, minced
* 1 cup cream
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh tarragon
* Lemon juice

## Directions

Melt the butter with the oil in a large skillet over quite high heat.
Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and fry in batches
until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Put all the chicken back
in the pan, add the chicken stock and reduce the heat to medium. Cover
and cook until tender, about 30 minutes.

Remove the chicken to a plate and keep warm. Reduce any leftover juices
until sticky. Add the wine and the shallots and reduce to a thickish
sauce, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and half the tarragon. Boil down
again to sauce consistency, 3 to 5 minutes.

Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Put back the
chicken pieces, turning to coat, then transfer to a platter. Pour the
sauce over, scatter over the remaining tarragon and serve.

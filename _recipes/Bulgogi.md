## Ingredients

* 1 pound beef sirloin or tenderloin
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
* 1 green onion, thinly sliced

### Marinade

* 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce
* 3 Tablespoons of water
* 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar
* 1 Tablespoon of honey
* 1 Tablespoon of sesame oil
* 1 Tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds
* 2 chopped green onions
* 4 cloves of minced garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper

## Directions

Thinly slice the beef against the grain.

Combine the marinade ingredients and add the beef. Marinate at least 30
minutes. If the beef is tough, marinate overnight, or add 1/2 cup
crushed Asian pear to the marinade.

Cook on a grill, or in a heavy pan over medium-high heat. Top with
sesame seeds and green onion.

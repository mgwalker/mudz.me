title: Chicken Enchiladas with Sour Cream Sauce
---

## Ingredients

* Two boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 medium-sized onion, diced (about 3/4 of a cup)
* 12 corn tortillas
* 1 Tablespoon of canola oil
* 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

### Sour Cream Sauce

* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 serrano chiles, diced
* 2 Tablespoons of butter
* 2 Tablespoons of flour
* 2 cups of chicken broth
* 2 cups of sour cream
* 1 teaspoon of cumin
* 8 fresh tomatillos, husks removed and cut in half or one 10 oz. can of
* tomatillos
* dash of cayenne
* salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Sprinkle the chicken breasts on each side with the salt and black
pepper. In a large cast-iron set on medium heat, and cook the chicken
breasts on each side for three minutes. Place in the oven and bake for
30 minutes. When the chicken is done, take the chicken out of the oven
and let cool. Then shred with two forks. Keep the oven on as you'll be
using it again.

While the chicken is baking, in a pot melt the butter. Throw in the
diced Serrano chiles and cook until soft, about three or four minutes.
Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. Add the flour and
cook for one more minute. Pour the chicken broth into the pot, and
whisking constantly cook until chicken broth has thickened. Stir in the
sour cream, cumin, and cayenne. Remove from heat.

If using fresh tomatillos, place them under the broiler on a foil-lined
sheet and cook on each side until blackened, about four minutes per
side. Place in a blender along with the sour cream sauce and puree until
smooth. If using canned tomatillos, skip the broiler step and just place
them in the blender with the sour cream sauce and proceed.

Heat the canola oil in a skillet and cook the corn tortillas on each
side a couple of minutes until soft. Wrap in a cloth to keep warm as you
continue to cook all 12.

To assemble the enchiladas, pour one cup of the sour cream sauce in the
bottom of a casserole pan. Take each corn tortilla and place in the
middle 1/3 cup of shredded chicken, 1 teaspoon of diced onions and 1
tablespoon of cheese.

Roll the tortillas around the filling and place the rolled tortillas
seam side down in the casserole dish. Cover the enchiladas with the
remaining sauce and cheese and bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until top
is brown and bubbling.

title: Garlic Knots
---

## Ingredients

* 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 2 tsp instant yeast
* 1¼ tsp salt
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* ¼ cup milk
* 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp lukewarm water
* 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
* 1 tsp Italian seasoning

### Glaze

* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 Tbsp melted butter
* 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* ½ tsp Italian seasoning

## Directions

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the dry
ingredients. Add the olive oil, milk, water, minced garlic, and Italian
seasoning.Mix until ingredients have formed
a dough. Knead on low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about
8 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn once to
coat, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise for about 1 hour, or
until doubled in bulk.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and need in flour until no
longer sticky. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces.

Roll each piece into a 10-inch long rope and tie into a knot. Take the
end lying underneath the knot and bring it over the top, tucking it into
the center. Take the end lying over the knot and tuck it underneath and
into the center.

Transfer shaped rolls to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes, until
puffy.

Glaze: finely mince the garlic. Mix the garlic with the melted butter,
olive oil, and Italian seasoning.

Preheat the oven to 350° F. Brush the glaze onto the shaped rolls. Bake
until set and lightly browned, about 15-18 minutes. Let cool slightly
before serving.

title: Marinated Kale
---

## Ingredients

* 1 bunch tender young kale
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1 large clove garlic, chopped very fine
* 1 - 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* Sea salt to taste

## Directions

Cut the kale into 1/2-inch wide strips.

Whisk together the lemon, garlic, and olive oil and gently toss the
mixture with the kale. Add seasoning to taste. Make sure the kale is
well coated. It should all appear shiny.

Let the kale marinate for at least 3 hours or overnight to tenderize.

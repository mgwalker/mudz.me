## Directions

Heat oven to 400° F. Toast the cumin for both the carrots and the crème
fraîche in a small pan set over medium heat until it becomes aromatic.
Remove from heat, and set aside.

Place carrots, bay leaf, split head of garlic, thyme and olive oil into
a bowl, and mix them together. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon cumin over the
carrots, and mix again.

Tip the carrot mixture onto a sheet pan, and spread evenly into one
layer, then season with salt and pepper and place in oven. Roast until
the carrots are soft and beginning to caramelize, 30 to 45 minutes.

Remove carrots from oven, discard aromatics and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette. Combine blood-orange juice, vinegar,
sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl, and whisk to incorporate. Slowly
add the olive oil while continuing to whisk, until the dressing is
emulsified. Add the carrots to the bowl, and toss to combine.

Make the cumin crème fraîche. Combine the crème fraîche, lemon juice and
remaining toasted cumin in a mixing bowl, and stir to combine. Thin the
mixture slightly with a few tablespoons of water. Add a pinch of salt.

Assemble the salad on a large serving plate. Put the crème fraîche in
the center of the plate, and using the back of a spoon, spread it evenly
across the bottom. Arrange the carrots on top of the crème fraîche.
Sprinkle the onion and the nuts on top of the carrots, then add the
supremes of blood orange. Sprinkle the herbs across the top of the
salad, and finish with a pinch or two of salt. Make a mess when serving,
so that everyone gets plenty of crème fraîche along with the vegetables.

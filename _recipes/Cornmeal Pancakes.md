title: Cornmeal Pancakes
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup cornmeal
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
* 2 1/2 cups buttermilk
* 2 large eggs
* 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Directions

Whisk cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt
together in a bowl. Using the whisk, make a well in the center. Pour the
buttermilk into the well and crack eggs into buttermilk. Pour the melted
butter into the mixture. Starting in the center, whisk everything
together, moving toward the outside of the bowl, until all ingredients
are incorporated. Do not overbeat. The batter can be refrigerated for up
to one hour.

Heat a large nonstick griddle or skillet, preferably cast iron, over low
heat for about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Turn heat
up to medium--low and using a measuring cup, ladle 1/3 cup batter into
the skillet. If you are using a large skillet or a griddle, repeat once
or twice, taking care not to overcrowd the cooking surface.

Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after
about 2 to 4 minutes. Cook until the other sides are lightly browned.
Remove to a plate and serve.

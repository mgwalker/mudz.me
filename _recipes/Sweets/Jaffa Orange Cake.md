Blend the cooked orange mixture with a hand blender until fairly smooth,
then strain. To enrich the jelly appearance, add a couple of drops of
red and yellow food color. Finally add 1 Tablespoon cointreau and the
sheet of gelatin. Leave to cool and firm up in the fridge.

Heat the oven to 350° F. Grease and flour two round cake pans. Whisk
together the soft margarine and sugar until very light and mousse-like.
Gradually add the beaten eggs a little at a time and the vanilla extract
to the batter, then fold in the sifted flour gently to keep the air in
the mixture. [  ]{.Apple-converted-space}Divide the mixture evenly
between the cake pans. Bake for about (20) mins.

cool completely.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

powdered sugar in a mixer and beat on a low speed until the mixture has
the consistency of breadcrumbs, then add the whole milk, turn up the
speed and beat until light and fluffy. Add the orange extract.

surface and turn this to the bottom. Spread the jelly between the two
cakes, reserving a small amount to spread over the surface of the cake.

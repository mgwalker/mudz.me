## Directions

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle, blend 1
cup of all-purpose flour with the butter, sugar, cocoa, almond flour and
salt at medium speed. Mix in the egg just until a soft dough forms.
Scrape the dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap and lay another
large sheet of plastic wrap on top. Roll out the dough between the
plastic wrap to a 12-inch round. Transfer the round to a baking sheet
and freeze until firm, 10 minutes. Heat the oven to 325° F.

Peel off the top sheet of plastic and invert the dough onto a 10-inch
fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Remove the remaining sheet of
plastic and gently press the dough into the pan. Trim the dough flush
with the rim. Freeze until firm, 10 minutes.

Line the tart shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or
beans. Bake in the center of the oven for 30 minutes, until the tart
shell is nearly cooked through. Remove the parchment and weights and
bake until the shell is cooked through, about 20 minutes longer.
Transfer to a rack and let cool. Lower the oven temperature to 250° F.

In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and milk and bring to a boil.
Remove from the heat. Add the chocolate and let stand until melted, 5
minutes. Whisk until smooth. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with the egg
yolk, then whisk in 1/2 cup of the chocolate cream. Thoroughly whisk
this custard into the chocolate cream in the saucepan. Pour the filling
into the tart shell and bake until set around the rim but still slightly
jiggly in the center, 30 minutes. Let the tart cool on a rack for 10
minutes, then refrigerate until chilled, 2 hours.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the milk and let stand 5
minutes. In a small saucepan, whisk the cream, sugar and cocoa over
moderate heat until the sugar is dissolved, 2 minutes. Remove from the
heat. Scrape the gelatin into the cocoa mixture, add the milk chocolate
and whisk until melted. Pour the glaze over the tart and spread it in an
even layer using an offset spatula. Refrigerate the tart until the glaze
is firm, 30 minutes. Serve with whipped cream.

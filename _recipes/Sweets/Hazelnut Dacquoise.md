## Ingredients


### Dacquoise

* 9 ounces blanched hazelnuts
* 10 1/2 ounces sugar
* 1 ounce corn starch
* 6 large egg whites
* pinch salt

### Chocolate Ganache

* 5 1/2 ounces plain chocolate, (around 35% cocoa solids), chopped
* 3 3/4 fluid ounces heavy cream

### Coffee Custard

* 20 fluid ounces whole milk
* 3 large egg yolks
* 4 1/2 ounces sugar
* 2 Tablespoons Camp coffee essence
* 1 3/4 ounces corn starch
* 10 fluid ounces whipping cream

### Praline

* 1 3/4 ounces sugar
* 36 whole blanched hazelnuts
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

### Decoration

* 3 1/2 ounces roasted, chopped hazelnuts

## Directions

For the dacquoise, heat the oven to 350° F. Tip the blanched hazelnuts
into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until coarsely ground.
Spread the nuts out in a layer in a roasting tin and bake for 10-12
minutes or until golden-brown, stirring every three minutes.

Remove from the oven, transfer to a large bowl and leave to cool. When
cool, stir in 3 1/2 ounces of the caster sugar and the corn starch.

Reduce the oven temperature to 300° F.

Line three baking trays with parchment paper and, using a small dinner
plate as a guide, draw a 8 1/4 inch diameter circle on each. Set aside.
Carefully position oven racks in the upper, middle and lower third of
the oven.

Make the meringue by pouring the egg whites into the clean bowl of a
free-standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the salt and
whisk on medium speed for about two minutes, or until white and frothy.
Increase the speed and add the remaining 7 ounces caster sugar, one
Tablespoon at a time, to make a stiff, glossy, peaked meringue. Gently
fold the ground hazelnut mixture through the meringue.

Spoon the meringue mixture to a large piping bag fitted with a [5/8
]{.s2}inch plain nozzle and pipe the meringue into a spiral starting at
the centre of each circle and working outwards to fill your template.

Bake for one hour, rotating the top and bottom baking trays halfway
through cooking. Keep an eye on the meringues toward the end of cooking
as they may catch and darken too much. Turn off the oven and leave to
cool in the oven, with the door open, for at least 45 minutes.

For the chocolate ganache, place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof
bowl. Pour the cream into a pan and heat until simmering. Take off the
heat and pour the cream over the chocolate. Stir until the mixture is
smooth. Cool, then place in the fridge to chill until really thick.
Spoon the ganache into a piping bag fitted with a medium star nozzle.
Set aside. (If the ganache is too stiff, allow to come to room
temperature and beat with a wooden spoon until a smooth piping
consistency.)

For the coffee custard filling, heat the milk in a heavy-based pan and
bring to the boil over a low heat. Meanwhile in a medium bowl, whisk the
egg yolks, caster sugar and coffee and coffee essence together. Whisk in
the corn starch, one Tablespoon at a time. Pour the hot milk over the
egg mixture, whisking continuously, then pour back into the pan. Bring
to the boil, whisking continuously, reduce the heat and simmer, whisking
for 2-3 minutes, or until smooth and very thick. (You need to use a
whisk during this process as the mixture will suddenly thicken and form
lumps.) Remove from the heat and leave to cool for at least an hour.

Whisk the whipping cream in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk
is removed from the bowl. Fold half of the cooled coffee mixture into
the cream, adding as much as necessary to form a spreadable consistency.

For the hazelnut praline, line a baking tray with non-stick baking
paper. Melt the caster sugar in a small frying pan until it turns
golden-brown or reaches 572° F on a sugar thermometer. Add the hazelnuts
and lemon juice, stir well and tip onto the lined baking tray. Using two
teaspoons and working quickly before the caramel sets, form 12 praline
clusters of three hazelnuts each for decoration.

To assemble the dacquoise, place one of the meringue layers on a large,
flat serving plate and spread with one-third of the coffee custard
filling. Place another meringue layer on top and spread with another
third of the coffee custard filling. Top with the final meringue layer
and spread the remaining coffee custard filling on the sides of the
dacquoise, leaving the top bare. Press the roasted chopped hazelnuts
onto the sides of the dacquoise to cover. Pipe 12 swirls of chocolate
ganache on the top of the dacquoise and decorate with the hazelnut
praline.

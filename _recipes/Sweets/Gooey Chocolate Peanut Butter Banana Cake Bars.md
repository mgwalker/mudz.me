title: Gooey Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Cake Bars
---

## Ingredients

* 12oz semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 2 ripe bananas, mashed
* 3 large eggs
* 1 cup granulated white sugar
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 3/4 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9\" or 8\" square baking pan and line
with a long strip of parchment paper that covers the bottom and
overhangs on both sides. Set aside.

Combine the chopped chocolate, peanut butter, and olive oil in a small
saucepan over low heat. Stir until the chocolate and peanut butter is
melted and evenly combined.Pour into a large
bowl and let cool for 2 minutes.

Whisk in the mashed bananas, followed by the eggs, one at a time until
all three are fully incorporated into the mixture. Stir in the sugar and
vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda,
then stir into the wet batter until fully incorporated. Pour the batter
into the prepared baking pan, smoothing out the top. Bake for about
18-20 minutes or until just set. A tester inserted into the center
should come out a little bit fudgey, but not wet. Remove from oven and
let cool at room temperature for 15 minutes. Transfer to the
refrigerator to set. Once firm (about 20 minutes), cut into bars and
serve.

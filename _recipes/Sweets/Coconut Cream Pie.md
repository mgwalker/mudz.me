## Ingredients


### Crust

* 2 cups flour
* 1 cup shortening
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup cold water

### Filling

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 2 Tablespoons cornstarch
* 3 egg yolks
* 2 1/2 - 3 cups milk
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/2 cup shredded coconut

### Meringue

* 3 egg whites
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 6 Tablespoons sugar

## DIrections

Heat the oven to 350Â° F.

Dissolve the sugar and salt in the water, then place in the refrigerator
to chill. Cut the shortening into the flour with a pastry blender.
Gradually add the water and work until a dough is formed. Cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick, carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie
pan, and prick all over with a fork. Line the pastry case with baking
parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove
the beans and parchment, carefully trim away the excess, and return to
the oven to bake until done. Set aside to cool completely.

In a medium saucepan, beat together the sugar, cornstarch, and egg
yolks. Gradually whisk in the milk, turn the heat to medium, and stir
constantly until thick. Turn off the heat, stir in the vanilla and
coconut, and set aside to cool for five minutes. Pour into the baked pie
crust and set aside.

In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites and cream of tartar
until foamy. Add the sugar gradually, and continue to whip until stiff
peaks form. Spread the meringue over pie, sealing the edges at the
crust. Bake for 10 minutes, until the top of the meringue is dry and
golden brown.

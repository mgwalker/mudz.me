title: Banana Chocolate Chunk Cookies
---

## Ingredients

* 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 cup butter, at room temperature
* 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup well-mashed very ripe banana
* 1 3/4 cups dark and milk chocolate chunks
* Flaky salt, for sprinkling

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F.

In a bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda.

Cream butter and sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a
large bowl with a hand mixer for several minutes, until very light and
fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla, and banana. Mix to combine, then scrape
down sides and bottom of bowl.

Add the dry ingredients and chocolate chunks. Mix just to fully combine,
but then stop to avoid over-mixing. Refrigerate 1 hour, loosely covered
with plastic wrap.

Form the dough into 1-inch balls and place on a lined baking sheet, 3
inches apart. Sprinkle with flaky salt and bake 14-16 minutes.

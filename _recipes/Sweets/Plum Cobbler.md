## Ingredients


### Filling

* 10-18 plums, sliced into thin wedges
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Zest of one orange
* 2 Tablespoons tapioca starch

### Topping

* 1 cup flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 heaping teaspoon baking powder
* 2 generous pinches of salt
* 1/2 cup butter
* Cold water

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425Â°F.

Toss the plums with sugar, orange zest, tapioca starch, and cinnamon.
Pour into an 8\" or 9\" round baking pan and bake for 12 minutes.

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; combine with
the sugar. Cut the butter into small cubes and mix into the flour
mixture with hands or pastry blender. Slowly add water until the dough
just hangs together.

Remove peaches from the oven and cover with the biscuit dough. Return to
the oven for 30 minutes, or until topping is golden brown.

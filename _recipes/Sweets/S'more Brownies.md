title: S'more Brownies

## Ingredients


### Crust

* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* 1 1/2 cups crushed graham cracker crumbs
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* Pinch fine salt

### Brownie

* 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
* 1 cup packed light brown sugar
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
* 4 large cold eggs
* 1 cup all-purpose flour

### Topping

* 4 cups large marshmallows

## Directions

Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat oven to 325Â° F.
Butter a 9" x 13" baking dish.

For the crust: Stir the melted butter together with the crumbs, sugar,
and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture evenly over the
bottom of the pan. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the brownie. Put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof
bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow
simmer; set the bowl on the pan without touching the water. Stir
occasionally until melted. Stir the light brown and white sugars,
vanilla and salt into the melted chocolate. Add the eggs and beat
vigorously to make a thick and glossy batter. Add the flour and stir
until just incorporated.

Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the top is crispy and a
toothpick inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean, with a few
crumbs, about 40 to 45 minutes.

Remove from the oven and carefully position a rack about 6 inches from
the broiler and preheat on low. Layer marshmallows across the top and
toast under the broiler until golden, (keep an eye on it, it can go
quick), about 2 minutes. Let cool, then cut into squares.

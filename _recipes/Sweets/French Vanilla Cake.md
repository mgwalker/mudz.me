---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup butter, softened
* 2 cups sugar
* 4 eggs, room temperature
* 2 3/4 cups flour
* 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup milk
* 2 Tablespoon vanilla

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F. Butter and flour two round cake pans. Line the
bottom of the pans with parchment paper.

Beat the butter for 3 minutes until light and fluffy. Add the sugar and
beat another 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat thoroughly
after each addition.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Start adding the flour cup at a time, alternating with the milk. Add the
baking powder, salt, and vanilla, mix well, and pour into the prepared
cake pans.

Bake for 25-30 minutes or when a knife inserted in the center of the
cake comes out clean. Transfer to a rack and cool for 5 minutes, then
run a knife around the sides of the cakes, unmold them and peel off the
paper liners.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Leave to cool completely.

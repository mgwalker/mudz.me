title: Flourless Chocolate Cake (Julia Child)
---

## Ingredients


### Cake

* 2 Tablespoons instant espresso
* 1/4 cup hot water
* 7 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
* 2 ounces baker\'s chocolate
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 4 eggs, separated
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 3/4 cup sifted cornstarch

### Icing

* 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate
* 1 ounces baker\'s chocolate
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Butter an 8-inch round cake pan

Add hot water and espresso in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering
water and stir, then add the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is
melted, then remove from the heat and beat in the butter.

Gradually beat together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and
lemon-colored. Gradually fold in the chocolate mixture to prevent eggs
scrambling. Beat the egg whites until foamy, then add the cream of
tartar. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. Fold in the cornstarch,
alternating with egg whites.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Lift and drop the pan to
settle the batter. Bake 15-18 minutes, until the sides are just set and
center is still moist). Set aside to cool for about 10 minutes, then
unmold.

Melt the icing chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering
water. Remove from the heat, then mix in the butter. Spread over the
cooled cake and let stand until chocolate is firm.

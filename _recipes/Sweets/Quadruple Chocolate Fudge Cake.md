## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F, and grease and line two round 8-inch cake pans.

For the cake, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking
soda, eggs, milk, and oil in a large mixing bowl. Beat until all the
ingredients are incorporated and the batter is smooth. Slowly add the
boiling water and mix.

Divide the batter equally between the cake pans and bake for 25-30
minutes.

When the cakes are cooked, let them cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Line
a wire rack with greaseproof paper and dust it with icing sugar. Turn
out the cakes and leave to cool completely on the prepared rack. When
the cakes have cooled, cut both the cakes in half horizontally, to make
to 4 layers.

For the jam, crush the strawberries. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, mix
together the strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Stir over low heat
until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to high, and bring the
mixture to a full rolling boil. Boil, stirring often, until the mixture
reaches 220° F. Turn off the heat and set aside.

For the chocolate buttercream, melt the chocolate. You can do this in a
microwave or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a bowl of simmering
water. Set aside to cool slightly.

Cream the butter and icing sugar together in a large bowl. When the
mixture is smooth, add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. Add
a little milk if the buttercream is too thick.

For the chocolate ganache, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
Gently heat the cream in a saucepan until it just comes to the boil,
then pour it over the chocolate. Stir the mixture until the chocolate is
melted. Set aside in a cool place.

For the whipped cream, beat the cream using a hand held mixer until soft
peaks form when the whisk is removed. Add the icing sugar, corn starch
and milk powder and beat until firm. Refrigerate until ready to use.

For the chocolate mirror glaze, mix the gelatin with the water and set
aside to dissolve. In a saucepan, heat the sugar, cream and 6
tablespoons water until it boils. Remove from the heat and add the
glucose and cocoa powder. Stir in the gelatin, mix well and strain
through a fine sieve. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

To assemble the cake, place a layer of cake on a serving plate. Spread a
layer of chocolate ganache on top and then a layer of whipped cream.
Spoon over some strawberry jam. Repeat with two more layers of cake and
place the final layer on top.

Cover the whole cake in butter cream and place in the freezer for 10
minutes. Pour the chocolate mirror glaze over the top of the cake.
Decorate as desired.

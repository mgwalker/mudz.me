title: Banana and Chocolate Bread Pudding
---

## Ingredients

* 1 loaf bread, broken into small pieces
* 6 eggs
* 3 cups heavy cream
* 6 ounces white chocolate
* 6 ounces dark chocolate
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 Tbsp vanilla
* 6 bananas, peeled and mashed
* 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted
* whipped cream

## Directions

Pre-heat oven to 350Â° F.

In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, sugar, cream, and vanilla to
create a custard base. Puree the bananas in a food processor; add the
banana puree to the custard base and mix well, then refrigerate.

Add the bread to the custard and allow it to absorb all of the liquid.
Add the white and dark chocolate to the mixture, and incorporate well.
Pour on to a non-stick baking mat and place in the oven for 18 minutes.

While the pudding is baking, place the bittersweet chocolate into a
small bowl and allow to melt.

Cut the pudding into individual serving. Top with whipped cream and
drizzle with the melted chocolate.

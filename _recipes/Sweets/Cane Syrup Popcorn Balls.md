title: Cane Syrup Popcorn Balls
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup sugar
* 1 1/3 cups cane syrup
* 2/3 cup water
* 2 tablespoons white vinegar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3-4 quarts popped corn, lightly salted
* 3/4 cup roasted salted peanuts
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

## Directions

In a saucepan, melt sugar, syrup, water, vinegar, and salt over medium
heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture reaches 260Â°F,
approximately 5-10 minutes. Watch carefully so mixture does not boil
over.

In a very large bowl. combine popcorn and peanuts. Cover a work surface
with waxed or parchment paper. When syrup mixture is ready, turn off
heat and stir in butter and baking soda.

Pour abut 2/3 of the syrup over the popcorn and set remainder over very
low heat. Mix popcorn well with a wooden spoon. Butter hands and form
mixture into balls, setting on a prepared surface to cool, working
quickly to prevent the syrup from hardening. If mixture does not hold
together, mix in the remaining syrup.

Cool and serve, or wrap individually and store in an airtight container.

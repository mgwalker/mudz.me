title: Banana Caramel
---

## Ingredients

* 2 very ripe bananas
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Directions

Cook the sugar and the water in a medium pot over medium heat, stirring,
until the sugar is just dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue to cook,
without stirring, until the syrup is a dark golden brown, 14 to 16
minutes more.

Remove from the heat and carefully add the vanilla, salt, and banana
puree. Stir quickly to combine.

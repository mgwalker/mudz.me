title: Clafoutis
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pint fresh berries, or other fruit
* 1 1/4 cups milk
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 large eggs
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 pinch salt

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F. Generously butter a 2 1/2-quart baking dish.

Pour the berries into the prepared baking dish. Blend the milk, sugar,
flour, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt in a blender until the batter is
smooth. Pour the batter over the blueberries and gently shake to remove
any air bubbles.

Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and center is set, 45 minutes to
1 hour. Cool until the clafoutis deflates and is just
warm.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

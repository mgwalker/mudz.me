* ---
* **Ingredients**
* Biscuits:[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1 tablespoon for
* dusting[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/4 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 tablespoon baking powder[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch
* cubes[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/2 cup chilled heavy cream, plus 2 tablespoons for
* brushing[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* zest of 1 orange
* For Strawberry Sauce:
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/4 cup orange juice
* 6 cups strawberries
* Whipped Cream:[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 2 cups chilled heavy cream[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 teaspoon almond extract[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 6 tablespoons sugar
* **Directions**
* Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment
* paper.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* For the biscuits: Pulse the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt
* in the food processor, about 5 seconds. Add the cold butter cubes. Using
* on/off turns, process until the mixture resembles coarse
* meal.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* In a liquid measure, combine the heavy cream and orange zest. Add the
* heavy cream-orange mixture to the dry ingredients in the processor and
* pulse just until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball (with
* floured hands if the dough is sticky). Gently knead 5 turns on a floured
* surface. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 3/4 inch-thick.
* Using a 3-inch diameter biscuit cutter, cut out 3 rounds. Cook\'s Note:
* To prevent the dough from sticking to the biscuit cutter, dip the edge
* of the cutter in flour before cutting out the
* biscuits.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* Gather the dough scraps and reroll as needed to make 3 more 3-inch
* rounds.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* Arrange the rounds on the prepared sheet. Brush with 2 tablespoons cream
* and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake the biscuits until pale
* golden and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25
* minutes. Cool 15 minutes. (Biscuits can be made 2 hours ahead.)
* In a medium bowl whisk together sugar, cornstarch and cranberry juice.
* In a large skillet combine strawberries with cornstarch mixture. Stir
* together and bring to a simmer over medium heat making sure to stir
* often. Turn down heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes or until
* thickened. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
* Combine the heavy cream, vanilla extract, almond extract and sugar in a
* food processor or a large bowl and whisk until soft peaks form.

## Ingredients

* 500 milliliters milk
* 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
* 6 egg yolks
* 100 grams sugar
* 40 grams all-purpose flour
* Pinch of salt
* 125 milliliters heavy cream, whipped

## Directions

Put the milk in a saucepan. Scrape the vanilla seeds into the milk and
throw in the pod. Bring just to a boil, remove from the heat, cover and
set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes.

Beat the yolks and sugar to pale, thick ribbons. Gradually beat in the
flour and salt. Whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture in a thin
stream. Return the mixture to the saucepan and bring to a boil over
medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Strain and
set aside to cool with a buttered piece of waxed paper on top to prevent
a skin from forming. When cool, fold in the whipped
cream.

## Ingredients

* 2¾ Cups Plain Flour
* 1 Teaspoon Salt
* ⅛ Cup Light Brown Sugar
* 1⅛ Cups Unsalted Butter
* ⅛ - ⅓ Cup Cold Water

## Directions

In a large bowl sieve in the flour, salt , sugar and mix. Cut the butter
into chunks and add them to the flour mixture. Rub the butter into the
flour until it resembles crumbs. Add the water slowly and mix very
gently until a smooth dough begins to form - you wont need it all.
Divide the dough in half and form into balls. Cover and refrigerate one
hour.

title: Mascarpone Cheesecake with Almond Crust
---

## Ingredients


### Crust

* 1 cup slivered almonds, lightly toasted
* 2/3 cup graham cracker crumbs
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

### Filling

* 16 oz cream cheese, room temperature
* 16 oz mascarpone cheese, room temperature
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 4 large eggs, room temperature

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Tightly wrap the outside of a 9-inch diameter springform pan with 2
3/4-inch-high sides with 3 layers of heavy-duty foil. Finely grind the
almonds, cracker crumbs, and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter
and process until moist crumbs form. Press the almond mixture onto the
bottom of the prepared pan (not on the sides of the pan). Bake the crust
until it is set and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Cool. Decrease
the oven temperature to 325°F.

For the filling: Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese,
mascarpone cheese, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth, occasionally
scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat in the
lemon juice and vanilla. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until
blended after each addition.

Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan. Place the springform
pan in a large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan
to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the
center of the cheesecake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken,
about 1 hour 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold).
Transfer the cake to a rack; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate until the
cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.

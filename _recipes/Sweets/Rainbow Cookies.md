## Ingredients

* 2 large eggs
* 2/3 cup plus 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
* Zest of 1 lemon
* 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 egg white, lightly beaten
* food coloring

## Directions

In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, vanilla, and lemon
zest. Gradually mix in the flour and salt, alternating with the eggs,
until smooth and well combined. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions
and color each with food coloring to make red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, and purple. Mix until the coloring is well distributed.Roll each
portion, on a piece of plastic wrap, into a long strip about 3 inches
wide, 11 inches long, and 1/4-inch thick. Wrap each strip with the
plastic wrap and chill until firm, about an hour.

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Place purple dough on a cutting board and brush
with egg white. Place blue dough on top of purple and brush with egg
white. Repeat with remaining dough in the order of green, yellow, orange
and red. Using a chef's knife, trim the edges and slice the dough into
1/4-inch thick rectangles. Place the cookies 1 inch apart on a lined
baking sheet. Bake 14-16 minutes.

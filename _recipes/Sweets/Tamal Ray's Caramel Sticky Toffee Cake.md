title: Tamal Ray's Caramel Sticky Toffee Cake
---

## Ingredients

* 250 grams unsalted butter
* 200 grams light brown sugar
* 4 large eggs
* 275 grams self-raising flour, divided
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 275 grams medjool dates, pitted and chopped
* 115 grams dried figs, chopped
* 100 grams prunes, chopped
* 3 Tablespoons lemon juice
* Zest of 3 lemons
* Zest of 1 orange

### Toffee Sauce

* 270 grams date syrup
* 135 grams unsalted butter
* 400 milliliters heavy cream

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F. Grease and line the base of two round 8-inch
cake pans. Place a small plate in the freezer.

Combine the dried fruit and lemon juice in a bowl. Coat the fruit with
25 grams of the flour and stir in the lemon and orange zests.

Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Gradually
beat in the eggs, beating well between each addition. Stir in the
remaining ingredients and the dried fruit mixture. Spoon the mixture
into the prepared cake pans and bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until a
skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.

Set aside to cool for 15 minutes, then remove from the pan, remove the
baking parchment on the base, and place on a wire rack to cool
completely.

Combine the date syrup, butter, and cream in a large saucepan and cook
over medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring often, until smooth and
bubbling, reaching 115-120° C. To test if it is ready, remove the plate
from the freezer and put a teaspoonful of the sauce in the middle. Leave
it for a minute then test the consistency - it should be spreadable and
not runny. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool and thicken to a
spreadable consistency.

Once the cake is cool, slice it in half horizontally. Place the bottom
half on a serving plate and spread the toffee sauce on top. Sandwich
with the top half and spread more toffee sauce neatly all over the sides
and top of the cakes.

## Ingredients


### Dough

* 1 tablespoon yeast
* 1/3 cup milk, room temperature
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted

### Filling

* 12 ounces farmer's cheese
* 1/3 cup sour cream
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 egg yolk
* Zest of one lemon

### Egg Wash

## Directions

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine yeast and milk and allow to
sit for a few minutes. Stir in the remaining dough ingredients. Mix well
until the dough forms a ball. Transfer to a covered container and allow
to rest for 30 minutes, then refrigerate overnight.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the filling ingredients and
mix well. Refrigerate until needed.

Heat oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, and set
aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle 1/8
inch thick. Cut into 4-by-4 inch squares. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of
filling into the center of each square. Pick up the corners of each
square and press the points together.

Arrange the pastries on the baking sheets about 1 1/2 inches apart. Beat
the egg and water together, and brush over the pastries. Bake until
golden, about 20 minutes.

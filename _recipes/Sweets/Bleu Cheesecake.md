title: Bleu Cheesecake
---

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup toasted bread crumbs
* 3/4 cup finely chopped toasted walnuts
* 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* 1 pound bleu cheese, at room temperature
* 1 pound cream cheese, at room temperature
* 4 eggs
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â°F.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine bread crumbs, walnuts and
melted butter and process until thoroughly combined. Press the mixture
on the bottom and partially up the sides of an 8-inch springform pan.
Set aside.

In a mixing bowl combine bleu cheese and cream cheese and mix until
smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper and combine well. Using a
spatula, transfer cheese mixture to the prepared pan and bake for 45 to
50 minutes, just until the cake is golden brown on top and puffed, and
not loose in the center. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool at
least 30 minutes before serving.

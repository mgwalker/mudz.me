parchment paper. Melt butter and chocolate in small saucepan over a low
heat. Stir in the ground nuts, cinnamon, and sugar. press evenly over
the base of the tin -- chill in the freezer.

Break the white chocolate into a bowl and melt very gently over a pan of
hot water (do not allow the chocolate to become too hot), stir
occasionally with a spoon until runny and smooth.

Whisk the cream cheese and soured cream together in a large bowl until
smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and whisk until completely
smooth with no lumps. Stir in the melted chocolate and mix together.

Pour in the tin and spread evenly over the chilled base. Bake in
preheated oven for about 45 minutes until firm around the edge and just
set in the middle. Remove from the oven. Using a small palette knife run
the knife around the edge of the tin and then allow to cool and chill.

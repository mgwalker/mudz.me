title: Penny Gleue's Apple Crisp
---

## Ingredients

* Apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
* cinnamon
* 1/4 cup water
* 3/4 cups flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup butter, softened

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

Arrange apple slices in the bottom of a 9" x 13" baking dish, enough to
cover the bottom 1/2" deep. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon and water.

Cut together the butter, flour, and sugar, until it forms a crumbly
mixture. Spread over the apples, and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.
Bake until the top is browned and crispy, and the apples are tender.

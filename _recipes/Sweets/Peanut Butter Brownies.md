title: Peanut Butter Brownies
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound unsalted butter
* 1 pound plus 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, divided
* 6 ounces unsweetened chocolate
* 6 extra-large eggs
* 3 tablespoons instant coffee granules
* 2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract
* 2 1/4 cups sugar
* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour a 12 by 18 by 1 1/2-inch
sheet pan.

Melt together the butter, 1 pound of chocolate chips, and the
unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl over simmering water. Allow to
cool slightly. In a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the eggs,
coffee granules, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the warm chocolate mixture
into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature.

In a medium bowl, sift together 1 cup of flour, the baking powder, and
salt. Add to the cooled chocolate mixture. Toss the remaining 12 ounces
of chocolate chips in a medium bowl with 1/4 cup of flour, then add them
to the chocolate batter. Pour into the prepared sheet pan. Spoon the
peanut butter over the top of the chocolate mixture and using a knife,
swirl it through the chocolate mixture.

Bake for 20 minutes, then rap the baking sheet against the oven shelf to
force the air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough. Bake
for about 10 to 15 minutes more or until a toothpick comes out clean. Do
not overbake! Allow to cool thoroughly, refrigerate, and cut into large
squares.

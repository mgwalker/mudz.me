## Ingredients

* 1 cup molasses
* 1/2 cup shortening
* 1 tablespoon ground ginger
* 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 3 cups flour

## Directions

Heat oven to 400Â°F. Butter a rimmed sheet pan and set aside.

In a small pan over low heat, melt molasses, shortening, and ginger.
Transfer to a mixer and mix on medium until well blended, about 3
minutes. Mix in sugar. Dissolve baking soda in a tablespoon of hot water
and mix into molasses mixture. Alternate adding buttermilk and flour,
beating well after each addition. Batter should be quite stiff. Add more
flour a tablespoon at a time, if needed.

Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake in lower third of oven 10-12
minutes, until risen and firm.

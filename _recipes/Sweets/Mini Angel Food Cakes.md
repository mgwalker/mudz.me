## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup powdered sugar
* 1/2 cup cake flour
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 6 large egg whites, at room temperature
* 3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Grease and flour 6 mini bundt pans.

Sift the confectioners\' sugar, cake flour and salt onto a sheet of
parchment paper. Sift again.

Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium
speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks
form, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar, about 1
Tablespoon at a time. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue
beating until stiff, shiny peaks form, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the vanilla
and beat a few seconds to combine.

Sprinkle one-quarter of the flour mixture over the egg white mixture and
gently fold with a rubber spatula. Fold in the remaining flour mixture
in 3 additions. Transfer the batter to the prepared Bundt pans.

Bake until the cakes feel springy and a toothpick inserted into the
center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Invert the pans onto a funnel
or the neck of a bottle and let cool completely. Loosen the edges of the
cakes with a small knife, tap the sides of the pans against the counter,
and unmold.

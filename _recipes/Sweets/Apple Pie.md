## Ingredients

* 5 pounds Jonathan apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
* 1 cup sugar
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 tablespoon water
* 3 tablespoons butter, cubed

## Directions

Preheat oven to 325Â°F.

Layer the apples into an unbaked pie crust. Stir together the flour,
cinnamon, and sugar, and pour over the apples. Combine the water and
vanilla, and add to the apples. Spread the butter evenly over the
apples. Cover with another pie crust, and cut slits to let steam escape.

Bake 1-1 1/2 hours.

title: Pineapple Tarts
---

## Ingredients

* 2 stick butters
* ½ Tbsp shortening
* 2 Tbsp icing Sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp pineapple essence (optional)
* 3 cups All Purpose Flour
* 2 Tbsp Milk Powder
* 2 Tbsp Cornflour

### Filling

* 12 oz. (weight) peeled, cored, diced pineapple (from 1 pineapple)
* 20 oz. peeled, seeded, diced winter melon (honeydew)
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup maltose syrup

## Directions

Cream butter, shortening and icing sugar till light and fluffy for
around 8 minutes. Add in egg and essence if using. Fold in all purpose
flour, cornflour and milk powder. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Place the pineapple in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until
pureed, stopping and scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, 18 to
20 pulses. Pour into a Dutch oven.

Place the melon in the food processor and pulse until very finely
shredded, 20 to 22 pulses. Transfer to the Dutch oven.

Cook the combined mixture over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally,
until most of the liquid has evaporated and the melon begins turning
translucent, about 20 minutes.

Reduce the heat to medium, add the sugar, and cook until the mixture has
thickened, about 8 minutes.

Stir in the maltose syrup and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture
is very thick, sticky, and uniformly light amber in color, 10 to 12
minutes.

Transfer mixture to a shallow bowl and refrigerate until cool. Divide
into 1 Tsp each.

Divide dough into 30 pcs and wrap around the pineapple filling.

Press it onto the square mould and bake it at 170°C for 15 -- 20 minutes
and turn it around to bake for another 15 minutes or till brown.

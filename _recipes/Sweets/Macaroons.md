## Ingredients

* 14 ounces sweetened shredded coconut
* 14 ounces sweetened condensed milk
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 2 egg whites, at room temperature
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 4 ounces semisweet chocolate

## Directions

Heat the oven to 325° F.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Combine the coconut, condensed milk, and vanilla in a large bowl. Whip
the egg whites and salt on high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with the whisk attachment until they make medium-firm peaks.
Carefully fold the egg whites into the coconut mixture. Drop the batter
onto sheet pans lined with parchment paper using either a 1 3/4-inch
diameter ice cream scoop, or 2 teaspoons. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes,
until golden brown. Set aside to cool.

Melt the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water.
Drizzle over the macaroons and allow to set.

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350°F.

For the pastry base, rub the flour into the butter until it resembles
breadcrumbs. Mix in the icing sugar.

Whisk the egg and milk together in a separate bowl and add to the flour
mixture. Use your hands to bring the dough together. Wrap in cling film
and transfer to the freezer for 10 minutes.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry as thinly as
possible.

Line the tin with the pastry, making sure to leave some extra in case it
shrinks (leave any excess pastry upright not hanging over the sides as
it could be difficult to trim later). Prick the base with a fork and
chill the filled tin for 15 minutes in the fridge.

Line the inside of the tin with baking paper and fill with baking beans.
Place the tin on a baking tray. Blind bake the pastry shell for 15
minutes. Remove the baking beans and leave the pastry to cool in the
tin.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F.

For the cream cheese filling, mix the cream cheese and sugar in a large
bowl until incorporated. Add the sour cream, egg, egg yolk, and flour.
Mix gently to avoid incorporating excess air and pour the mixture into
the pastry case, leaving a small lip at the top which will be filled
with sauce later.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

For a ginger beer cheesecake, scatter the chopped ginger over the
surface, or the lemon zest for a lemonade cheesecake. For a cream soda
cheesecake, swirl in the vanilla paste.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Place the tin on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 45 minutes,
or until each cheesecake is set with a slight wobble in the centre.
Leave to cool in the tin.

For the ginger beer topping, heat the cream until just boiling then pour
it over the chocolate. When melted, stir in the stem ginger syrup.

For the lemonade topping, heat the cream until just boiling then pour it
over the chocolate. When melted, stir in the lemon extract and food
coloring.

For the cream soda topping, heat the cream until just boiling then pour
it over the chocolate. When melted, stir in the vanilla paste.

Once the topping has cooled a little, pour over the cheesecake. Cool in
the fridge or freezer.

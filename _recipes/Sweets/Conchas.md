## Ingredients

* 500 grams flour, plus extra for dusting
* 125 gramssugar
* 7 1/2 grams dry active yeast
* 3 grams salt
* 100 grams unsalted butter, room temperature
* 100 grams eggs
* 5 milliliters vanilla extract
* 120 milliliters milk, warm

### Topping

* 125 grams shortening
* 125 grams powdered sugar
* 150 grams flour
* 10 grams cocoa powder
* 1 gram cinnamon

## Directions

Mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer at
medium speed, just to mix it well. Add the butter and mix well (using
the stand mixer with the hook attachment), then mix in the eggs and
vanilla extract and slowly pour the milk in little by little until the
dough comes together. Keep beating the mixture for about 7 minutes at
medium speed. Add a little more flour around the inside of the bowl (2-3
Tablespoons), just enough for the dough to separate from the container.
The dough should be soft and slightly sticky.

Place the dough on a floured working table and knead it just enough to
shape it into a ball. Place this ball in a large greased bowl to rest.
Cover it with a plastic wrap and a kitchen napkin. Let the dough rest in
a warm place for about 2 hours until it doubles in size.

While the dough is rising, prepare the sugar topping. Mix together the
flour, cocoa powder, and cinnamon in a bowl. Soften the shortening with
a spatula until it is very creamy, and then add the powdered sugar. Add
in the flour mix little by little. Set this paste aside to use later.

Once the dough has risen and doubled in size, place it onto a floured
surface and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 16
small balls (60 grams each), and place onto lined baking sheets. Using
your hands, grease the top of each ball with a little shortening. To add
the topping, flour your hands and divide the topping paste into 16
balls. Use your hands to press down on each one to form a small, flat
circle. Place this disk onto the ball of dough, and press it down very
firmly. Use a small, sharp knife to make slits in the sugar paste. Allow
the conchas to rise in a warm place until they are almost double in
size.

While the conchas are rising, heat the oven to 325Â° F. Bake for 20
minutes, or until the bottom of the conchas are lightly golden.

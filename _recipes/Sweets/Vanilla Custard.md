title: Vanilla Custard
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup sugar[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 3 Tablespoons corn starch[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1/2 teaspoon salt[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 4 egg yolks[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 3 cups milk[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 2 teaspoons vanilla paste

## Directions

In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the sugar, corn starch , salt, and
egg yolks. Pour the milk into a medium saucepan and scald it over
moderately low heat. (The milk should steam and form small bubbles at
the edges, but not come to a boil.) Pour 1 cup of the hot milk into the
bowl with the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Whisk in the rest
of the milk, then pour the whole mixture back into the saucepan. Whisk
frequently over moderately low heat until thickened, and a candy
thermometer reads 170° F. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter
and vanilla paste. Place heavy-duty plastic wrap directly on the surface
of the custard. Chill for three hours.

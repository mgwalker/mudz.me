## Ingredients

* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 cups buttermilk, shaken
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* Zest of one lemon
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 cups fresh blueberries

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line muffin tins with paper liners.

Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large
bowl and mix together. In a separate bowl, mix together the buttermilk,
butter, lemon zest, and eggs. Make a hole in the center of the dry
ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix
with a fork just until blended. Fold the blueberries into the batter.

Fill the cups 3/4 full with batter. Bake 20-25 minutes.

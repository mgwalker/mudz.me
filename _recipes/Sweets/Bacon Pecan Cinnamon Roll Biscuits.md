title: Bacon Pecan Cinnamon Roll Biscuits
---

## Ingredients


### Dough

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 Tablespoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 8 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 3/4 cup half and half

### Filling

* 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 6 ounces bacon, cooked and crumbled
* 1/2 cup chopped pecans

### Icing

* 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1 Tablespoon whole milk
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Pinch salt

## Directions

Heat the oven to 450° F and lightly grease a baking sheet or a 10-inch
cast iron skillet.

To make the biscuits, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Cut the stick of butter into pieces, and work into the flour
mixture with your hands or a pastry blender until it resembles pea-sized
crumbs. Add the half and half, stirring until it's loose and sticky.

Place the dough on a lightly-floured surface and knead it for a few
seconds until it comes together. Roll the dough out into a large
rectangle, about 13x9 inches, with the long side facing you. (Make sure
you can lift the dough. If it's sticking, add more flour underneath.)
For the filling, spread the softened butter onto the dough, leaving a
½-inch border around the edges. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon
then evenly sprinkle over the butter. Top the cinnamon-sugar with the
crumbled bacon and pecans.

Starting on one of the long sides, roll the dough and pinch ends to
seal. Cut off 12 1-inch slices from the rolled dough, and place the
sliced rolls close together into the baking dish. Bake uncovered for
15-17 minutes or until lightly browned.

To make the frosting, stir together the powdered sugar, butter, milk,
vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Spread onto rolls when they come out of
oven. Serve warm.

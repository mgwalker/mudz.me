## Ingredients

* 8 oz chicken breast, cut into bite-size cubes
* 1 cup fresh basil leaves (optional)
* 1 cup cornstarch
* 2 cups oil for deep-frying
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper salt, or to taste (or 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8
* teaspoon white pepper)

### Marinade

* 1 Tablespoon scallions, chopped finely
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon ginger, minced
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 Tablespoons water
* 1 Tablespoon rice wine
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 Tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper salt (or 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon white
* pepper)

## Directions

Mix all the ingredients of Marinade in a big bowl, stir well. Add the
chicken pieces and marinate for 30 minutes.

Heat up the oil in the wok for deep-frying. Coat the chicken with the
cornstarch evenly. Deep-fry the chicken until they turn golden brown,
remove from the oil and set aside.

Pour the oil out and add the basil leaves and stir a few times before
adding the chicken back into the wok. Remove from the wok, add the
pepper salt and toss well with the chicken. Serve immediately.

title: Onion Rye Rolls
---

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups dark rye flour
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
* 2 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 Tablespoon active dry yeast
* 1 cup milk, room temperature
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup finely chopped onion
* 2 Tablespoons caraway seeds

## Directions

In a large bowl, combine the rye flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour,
sugar, salt, and yeast. Pour in the milk, water, and oil. Draw in the
flour to make a thick batter, and add the onion and caraway. Stir in the
remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough holds together and can
be lifted from the bowl.

Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead aggressively 8-10
minutes, adding sprinkles of flour as needed if dough is too sticky.
Place the dough in a large oiled bowled, turning once to coat. Set in a
warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough and turn out on a floured work surface. Allow the
dough to relax for 5 minutes. Form into rolls and place in an oiled
baking dish. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume.

Heat the oven to 375Â°F. Bake the rolls until a light, golden brown crust
forms, about 45 minutes. Rolls are done when a thump produces a hollow
sound.

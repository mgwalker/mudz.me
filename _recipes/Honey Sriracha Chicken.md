title: Honey Sriracha Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 4 chicken thighs, deboned but skin-on (12 oz chicken)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons honey
* 1 Tablespoon Tamari or soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon Sriracha chili sauce
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
* Pinch of salt
* 1 Tablespoon oil

## Directions

Combine the honey, soy sauce, sriracha, vinegar, and garlic in a bowl.
Add the chicken and marinate at least 30 minutes.

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Transfer the chicken to the
skillet and cook on both sides, until they turn golden brown and are
cooked through. Add the remaining marinade to the skillet. As soon as
the sauce thickens, remove from the heat and serve.

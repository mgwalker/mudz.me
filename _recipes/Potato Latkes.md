title: Potato Latkes
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups potatoes, peeled and grated
* 2-3 Tablespoons grated onion
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 Tablespoons matzo four (or all-purpose flour)
* 2 teaspoons salt
* Oil for frying

## Directions

Place the potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much
moisture as possible.



In a medium bowl stir the potatoes, onion, eggs, flour and salt
together.

In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil
until hot. Place large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil,
pressing down on them to form 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick patties. Brown on
one side, turn and brown on the other. Serve with applesauce.

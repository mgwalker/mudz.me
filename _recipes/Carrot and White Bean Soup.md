title: Carrot and White Bean Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 4 ounces pancetta, cubed
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
* 1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and chopped
* 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 2 cups cooked pinto beans
* 1 cup reserved bean broth
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Chopped fresh parsley

## Directions

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and
cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and chewy, about 7--10
minutes. Remove the pancetta and reserve, leaving the oil in the hot
pan. Add the onion, garlic, thyme, and carrots, and cook until soft,
about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, taking care to scrape any
caramelized bits off the bottom of the pot, and stir to incorporate them
into the liquid. Continue cooking for 10 minutes.

Add the beans and the broth to the carrot mixture. Stir well and then
puree. Cook the blended soup for another 10 minutes over medium-low
heat. Season with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with the reserved
pancetta, chopped parsley, and drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound black gram
* 2 ounces kidney beans
* 3 cups water
* 1 Tablespoon oil
* 1 red chili, deseeded and diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon ginger, minced
* 1 Tablespoon coriander
* 1 Tablespoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 5 tomatoes
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 cup cream

## Directions

Rinse the beans to remove any dirt, then place in a large pot and cover
with an inch of water. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and
cover. Let the beans soak at least one hour.

Drain the beans and add three cups of water. Bring to a boil and reduce
heat to low. Simmer until the beans are tender, at least one hour. Pour
into a blender and puree.

Puree the tomatoes with the chili, garlic, and ginger. Heat the oil in a
large pot. Add the tomatoes and spices, and stir until combined. Cover
and cook over medium heat until thick, about 10 minutes. Add the beans
and mix thoroughly. Cook until warmed through, 4-5 minutes. Add the
butter and cream, and stir until combined. Continue cooking another 10
minutes, or to desired consistency. If too thick, add water 1/2 cup at a
time.

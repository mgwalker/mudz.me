## Ingredients

* 1 medium tomato, roughly chopped
* 1 habanero pepper, stem removed
* 1/4 medium onion roughly chopped
* 1 small red bell pepper, roughly chopped
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
* 3/4 teaspoons hot ground chili pepper
* 3/4 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons onion powder
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
* 1 1/4 cups medium-grain rice
* Water, as needed

## Directions

Combine the tomatoes, habanero, and onions, and pur√©e in a blender. Add
the bell pepper and blend until smooth.

Heat he vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the blended
mixture along with the salt, curry powder, ground chili pepper, garlic
powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger, and thyme to the oil and bring
to a boil. Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to
low.

Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. After
25-30 minutes, check; if rice is too saucy, remove the lid to cook off
the excess sauce. If too dry, add 1 to 2 cups of water and stir.

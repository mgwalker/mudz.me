title: Orange Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 10 oz boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized cubes
* Oil for deep-frying
* 1 Tablespoon cooking oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced

### Orange Sauce

* 1/4 cup orange juice
* 1/2 teaspoon orange zest
* 1 Tablespoon garlic chili sauce, optional
* 3 Tablespoons chicken broth
* 1 Tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 Tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon corn starch
* Pinch of salt

### Batter

* 1 egg white
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/3 cup water, ice cold
* 1 Tablespoon cooking oil
* Pinch of salt

## Directions

In a bowl, mix all the ingredients for the orange sauce together. Whisk
to combine well. In another bowl, whisk all the batter ingredients until
the batter is smooth. Drop in the chicken cubes, coat well and set
aside.

Heat up a wok or non-stick skillet with oil. Gently drop in the battered
chicken cubes, one by one, making sure it is spread out to prevent
sticking and over crowding the wok or skillet. Deep-fry until the
chicken pieces turn golden brown and become crispy. Remove using a
strainer and drain on paper towels.

Transfer the deep-frying oil to a container and keep 1 tablespoon in the
wok or skillet. Add the garlic and stir fry until aromatic or light
brown in color. Pour in the sauce, stir, and bring it to a light simmer.
Toss in the deep-fried chicken, stir to combine well. Dish out, garnish
with orange slices, top with white sesame and serve immediately with
steamed rice.

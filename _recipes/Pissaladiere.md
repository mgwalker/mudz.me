## Ingredients


### Dough

* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 package (0.25 oz) instant yeast
* 1 1/4 cups water
* 2 teaspoons olive oil

### Toppings

* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 1/2 pounds onions, thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
* 1 bay leaf
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1-2 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced
* Dry-aged mozzarella and parmesan cheeses
* Other toppings

## Directions

Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large bowl. Mix with
hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. The bowl should be
at least 4 to 6 times to volume of the dough to account for rising.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are
well-sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up
to 24. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.

Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, then transfer it to a
well-floured work surface. Divide dough into two pieces and form each
into a ball by holding it with well-floured hands and tucking the dough
underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a tight ball.

Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil in the bottom of two 10-inch cast iron
skillet or round cake pans. Place 1 ball of dough in each pan and turn
to coat evenly with oil. Using a flat palm, press the dough around the
pan, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom
and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough
sit at room temperature for two hours. After the first hour, adjust an
oven rack to the middle position and turn the broiler to 475Â°F.

Heat the oil in a sauce pan and add the onion, herbs, salt, and pepper.
Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft (about 30 minutes).
Remove the bay leaf.

After two hours, dough should be mostly filling in the pan up to the
edges. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills in every
corner, popping any large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of the
dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around
the dough until there are no air bubbles left underneath and the dough
is evenly spread around the pan.

Bake the dough for 7-8 minutes, then remove from the oven. Spread the
onions over the dough, place the tomato slices in a layer over the
onions, then top with cheese. Place back in the oven and bake for
another 7-8 minutes, until the crust is brown and cheese is melted.

---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
* 3/4 - 1 cup buttermilk, chilled

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 450°F and line a baking tray with greaseproof
paper.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl.
Place in the freezer for half an hour.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Add the chilled butter, and using your fingers, rub the butter into the
flour until you get pea-sized lumps. Add the buttermilk and stir gently
until all the flour is incorporated and a loose dough comes together. On
a lightly floured surface, and with floured hands, turn the dough out
and shape it into a rough ball. Gently roll the dough out to about
1/4-inch thick and fold over.

Cut out some circles of dough and place them on the prepared baking tray
close together. Continue cutting out circles until all the dough is
used, then put the biscuits in the oven. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Once
they're lightly brown on top they're read to come
out.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

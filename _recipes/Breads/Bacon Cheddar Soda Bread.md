title: Bacon Cheddar Soda Bread
---

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces cooked bacon, crumbled
* 4 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 Tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
* 1 cup (4 ounces) grated Irish cheddar
* 4 green onions, chopped
* 1 1/2 cups buttermilk

## Directions

Heat the oven to 400Â° F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, kosher salt,
granulated sugar, Irish cheddar, bacon, and green onions until well
blended. Pour in the buttermilk and mix until the dough comes together.

Form the dough into a round loaf and place on the baking sheet. With a
knife, cut a cross all the way through the dough. Bake for 40-45 minutes
or until the loaf is lightly browned and sounds hollow when tapped on
the bottom.

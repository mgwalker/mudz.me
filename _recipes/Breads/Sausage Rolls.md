title: Sausage Rolls
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup whole milk
* 8 Tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
* 1 Tablespoon active dry yeast (1 envelope)
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 large egg yolks
* 12 ounces sausage, cut into 8 pieces

## Directions

On low heat, warm the milk and 4 tablespoons of the butter until the
milk is just beginning to steam, but not boiling, and the butter is
melted. Remove from the heat.

Pour the milk and butter into a large mixing bowl, then stir in the
yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour. Cover the dough
and let it rise until it is bubbling and porous, about 30 minutes.

After the dough has risen, beat together the oil and egg yolks. Pour the
eggs into the risen flour mixture and blend. Slowly stir in the
remaining flour until the dough comes together and is soft but not
sticky. Pour the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5
minutes or until smooth.

Place the kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and place in the
refrigerator. Allow to rise overnight.

Grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. After the dough has
risen, punch it down and pull off 8 even-sized pieces. In your hands,
roll pieces into balls and then flatten them to about 4-inches round in
diameter. Place in the center of each piece of dough a piece of boudin.
Fold one side of the dough to the other and seal by pinching on all
sides. Cover and allow to rise for 45 more minutes.

After 45 minutes, preheat the oven to 375Â°F and melt the remaining 4
tablespoons of butter. Brush the tops of the rolls with half the melted
butter, and then bake uncovered for 15-18 minutes or until lightly
browned. When you remove the rolls from the oven, brush the tops with
the remaining butter.

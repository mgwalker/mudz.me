title: Dandan Noodles
---

## Ingredients

* 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 Tablespoons grated ginger
* 2 Tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 Tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 Tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 Tablespoon black vinegar
* 1 Tablespoon chili oil
* 1/4 cup chicken broth
* 8 ounces ramen noodles
* 1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts, chopped
* 3 scallions, finely chopped

## Directions

Place the peanut butter, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame
oil, black vinegar, and chili oil into the bowl of a mini-food
processor. Process until the mixture is well combined and forms a paste,
1 to 2 minutes. With the processor running, gradually add the chicken
broth and process until the sauce is creamy and well combined, 1 to 2
minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, cover, and set aside.

Place 4 quarts water into a large pot and bring to a boil over high
heat. Add the noodles and cook until al dente, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Drain
thoroughly in a colander. Add the noodles to the bowl with the sauce and
toss to combine. Serve topped with the peanuts and scallions.

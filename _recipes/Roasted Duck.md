title: Roasted Duck
---

## Ingredients

* 1 whole duck
* 1/4 cup light soy sauce
* 1/4 cup dark soy sauce
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons Chinese five spice powder
* 1 4-inch piece of ginger, halved and crushed

## Directions

Heat the oven to 375Â° F. Rinse the duck and pat dry with paper towels.

Combine the soy sauces, sugar, and five spice in a small bowl. Place the
duck in a roasting pan. Using your fingers, loosen the duck's skin, then
rub the mixture over and under the skin, and inside the cavity. Place
the ginger in the duck's cavity, then truss with kitchen string.

Roast the duck on a rack, breast side down, basting regularly, for 45
minutes. Turn and cook, breast side up, basting regularly, until the
juices run clear, about another 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and
rest for 15 minutes before carving.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion, diced
* 8 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 large fresh tomatoes, chopped
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced
* 1 1/2 pound lean ground beef
* 1 Tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 Tablespoon berbere
* 1 Tablespoon smoked paprika
* 1 Tablespoon ground coriander seeds
* 1 15-ounce can of tomato sauce
* 2 Tablespoons dried oregano
* 2 Tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 box lasagna noodles
* 4 cups shredded mozzarella, divided
* 2 cups shredded orange cheddar
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan

## Directions

Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Add onions and allow to allow to sweat for about 3 minutes, then stir in
tomatoes, garlic, and green onions. Cook for 3-5 more minutes. Add beef
to the pot, being careful to break up clumps with wooden spoon. Add salt
and pepper to taste, then cook until meat is browned, about 10 minutes.

Add tomato paste and berbere to pot; allow to cook for 5 minutes before
adding tomato sauce, paprika, coriander, bay leaves, oregano, and basil.
Reduce heat and simmer for up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Heat oven to 375Â° F and grease glass casserole pan. Boil lasagna noodles
in a large pot of salted water, until just shy of al dente---about 7 or
8 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Immediately before beginning to layer the lasagna, remove the bay leaves
and stir 1 cup of mozzarella directly into the sauce mix.

Ladle meat sauce mixture directly onto the pan, spreading to cover
evenly. Follow with a layer of noodles, then sauce, then both the
mozzarella and cheddar. Continue alternating until the lasagna is
constructed. Sprinkle parmesan over the top layer of mozzarella and
cheddar, then cover lasagna with a layer cooking spray-treated aluminum
foil. Bake covered for 45 minutes, then remove foil and bake for another
15 minutes or until a significant portion of the top cheese layer has
browned. Allow to cool at least 30 minutes before slicing.

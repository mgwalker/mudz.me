title: Oatmeal Pancakes
---

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups rolled oats
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 4 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 2 Tablespoons pure maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Canola oil or melted butter

## Directions

Combine the oats and buttermilk in a medium bowl and let sit for at
least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.

Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl until combined.

Whisk together the eggs, milk, maple syrup and vanilla until smooth, and
then stir in the oat mixture. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and
mix until just combined (can be lumpy). Cover and let rest for 15
minutes.

Place a nonstick griddle or nonstick frying pan over medium heat and
brush with oil or melted butter. Pour the batter in scant 1/4 cup
portions onto the griddle and cook until pancakes are browned on the
bottom and the edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn
over with a spatula and cook another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Repeat. Serve
immediately.

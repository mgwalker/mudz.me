title: Fig Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds green or purple figs, stemmed and cut into 1/2-inch
* pieces
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 Tablespoon Pomona\'s Universal Pectin (optional)
* 4 teaspoons calcium water

## Directions

Macerate the figs with the sugar and pectin overnight.

Pour into a large non-reactive pot and add the remaining ingredients.
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until the fruit is soft and the liquid runs off the side
of a spoon in thick, heavy drops, about 20 minutes.

Spoon the jam into three 1/2-pint jars, leaving 1/4 inch of space at the
top. Close the jars and process in a hot water bath for 15 minutes.

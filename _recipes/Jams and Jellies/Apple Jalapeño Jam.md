title: Apple Jalapeño Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 pounds baking apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice
* 2 to 4 jalapeños, seeded and diced
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup vinegar
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

## Directions

Place a plate in the freezer.

Add the apples, jalapeños, water, and apple cider vinegar to a
non-reactive sauce pot. Bring to a boil and then turn the heat down to
low and simmer uncovered, while occasionally stirring, until the apples
are soft, about 10 minutes. If the liquid gets too low during this
process, you can add more water a Tablespoon at a time.

Once the apples are soft, stir in the granulated sugar, the brown sugar,
the cinnamon, and the salt. As you stir, mash the apples against the
side of the pot with the back of your spoon. Alternatively, you can use
a potato masher. You can make it as chunky or mashed as you like. For
instance, I prefer mine to leave a few apple chunks in my jam for
texture. Continue to cook the jam for 20 minutes, while occasionally
stirring.

After about 20 minutes, take the plate out of the freezer and place a
spoonful of the jam on the plate. The jam is ready wHen it doesn't run
after 15 seconds.

Ladle into clean canning jars to within 1/8 inch of top. Wipe jar rims.
Set clean, flat lids on top. Screw on bands. Process in boiling water
for 5 minutes. Let cool at least 24 hours. Check seals by pressing
firmly on centers of the lids.

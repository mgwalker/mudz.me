title: Mango Chili Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 8 fresh jalapeño chilies (6 to 9 oz.)
* 6 cups coarsely chopped peeled ripe mangoes
* 3⁄4 cup lemon juice
* 1 (1 3/4 ounce) package dry pectin, for low-sugar recipes
* 4 cups sugar

## Directions

Broil chilies on a small baking sheet 3 to 4 inches from heat, turning
as needed, until chilies are charred and blistered all over, 10 to 12
minutes. Cool. Remove and discard skin, stems, and seeds. Coarsely chop
chilies.

In a 6- to 8-quart pan, combine mangoes, chilies, and lemon juice.

Mix pectin with 1/4 cup sugar and stir into mangoes. Bring to a rolling
boil over high heat -- keep stirring. Add remaining 3 3/4 cups sugar and
stir until mixture returns to rolling boil. Stir and boil exactly 1
minute longer. Remove from heat.

Ladle into clean canning jars to within 1/8 inch of top. Wipe jar rims.
Set clean, flat lids on top. Screw on bands. Process in boiling water
for 5 minutes. Let cool at least 24 hours. Check seals by pressing
firmly on centers of the lids.

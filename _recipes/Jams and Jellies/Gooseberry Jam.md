title: Gooseberry Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound gooseberries
* 1 pound sugar
* 1/2 cup water

## Directions

Place a small plate in the freezer.

Put half the gooseberries and the water in a large, heavy saucepan and
bring to a boil over medium heat. Crush berries slightly with a potato
masher, add remaining gooseberries, then add sugar. Mix well. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring often, until
berries have softened and broken down, about 10 minutes.

Spoon a little of the gooseberry syrup onto the chilled saucer. When you
tip the saucer, the mixture should be thick and jammy, not runny. If
mixture is not thick enough, continue boiling and testing until thick.
This may take an additional 20 to 30 minutes, as the pectin content of
the berries will differ with variety, size, and season.

Allow jam to cool, then transfer to containers, cover, and refrigerate
until ready to use.

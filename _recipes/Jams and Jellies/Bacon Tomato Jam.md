title: Bacon Tomato Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound bacon
* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, chopped
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 2 Tablespoons white sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ground mustard
* 1 Tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* Dash cayenne pepper

## Directions

Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy. Drain on paper
towels.

Drain off all but 2 Tablespoons of the bacon grease. Add the chopped
onion to the skillet, making sure to scrape off any brown bits from the
bottom of the pan. Cook onion until translucent, 4-6 minutes.

Crumble the bacon and add it back to the skillet along with the
remaining ingredients. Stir everything together. Increase the heat to
medium high and bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer
mixture for 45-60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture is
thick.[Â ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Serve warm or cool and store in a sealed container in the fridge. The
mixture makes about 2 cups and will stay good in the fridge for 2-3
weeks.

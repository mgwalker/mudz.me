## Ingredients

* 4 cups water
* 1 1/2 cup white vinegar
* 4.15 ounces pickling salt
* 2 large cucumbers
* 6 cloves garlic
* 4 sprigs fresh cilantro
* 1/2 teaspoon dill seed 
* 1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
* 1/2 coriander seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
* 2 dried red chiles, or 1/4 teaspoon dried chile flakes

## Directions

Add the water, vinegar, and salt to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and leave to cool.

Once the brine is cool, sterilize a quart mason jar. Wash, dry, and slice the cucumber into desired portions. Add to the jar along with the garlic, dill, dill seed, mustard seed, and dried red chile. Pour the brine over the top to fill the jar, seal, and store in the refrigerator a minimum of 2 weeks, and up to 4 months.

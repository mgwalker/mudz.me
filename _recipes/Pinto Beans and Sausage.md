title: Pinto Beans and Sausage
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound dried pinto beans
* 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil or bacon grease
* 1/2 pound smoked kielbasa, cut into 1/2-inch dice
* 1/2 medium yellow onion, diced
* 1 to 2 jalapeños, seeded, stemmed, and diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup water
* 2 Tablespoons chopped cilantro
* 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

## Directions

Rinse and sort the beans. Place in a large pot or Dutch oven, cover with
two inches of water, bring the pot to a boil then turn off the heat,
cover the pot, and allow the beans to soak for an hour. After an hour
when the beans have almost doubled in size, drain and rinse the beans
and rinse the pot.

Place the pot back on the stove and heat the oil over medium-low heat.
Add the sausage, and while occasionally stirring, cook until it just
begins to crisp and some of the fat is rendered, about 3-5 minutes. Add
to the pot the onion and jalapeños and cook until softened, about 5
minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 more seconds. Pour in the water
and deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom of the pan to incorporate any
stuck bits.

Return the beans to the pot and add enough water to cover the beans by 1
inch, about 6 more cups. Stir in the cilantro, chili powder, cumin,
oregano, smoked paprika, black pepper, and salt, turn the heat up to
high and bring the pot to a boil. Once it's boiling, turn the heat down
to low and then simmer partially covered until tender, which can take
anywhere from 2 hours to 3 1/2 hours, depending on the age of the
beans.

Keep an eye on the beans as they cook, making sure the liquid doesn't
get too low (if it does, add about 1/4 cup more water to the pot) and
gently stir every half hour or so. I also like to taste the broth after
1 1/2 hours and see if the seasonings need any adjusting. You'll know
they're done when the broth is rich and brown with most of the
vegetables dissolved, and the beans, of course, are
tender.

When the beans are done to your satisfaction, taste again and adjust the
seasonings---at this point I usually add a few more dashes of salt,
black pepper, and smoked paprika. Serve the beans warm topped with
sliced jalapeños, though if you have the time, let the beans rest
overnight in the refrigerator and then reheat, as they only get better
the next day.

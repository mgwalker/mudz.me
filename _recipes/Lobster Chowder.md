title: Lobster Chowder
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
* 6 cups lobster broth or cold water
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 5 pounds steamed and shucked lobster, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 3 cans evaporated milk
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1 cup cream

## Directions

In a large pot over low heat, melt two tablespoons of butter. Add the
onion and cook until soft, about five minutes. Add the potatoes and
broth, and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer 30
minutes, until the potatoes begin to soften.

While the potatoes are simmering, melt two tablespoons of butter in a
large skillet over medium-high heat. Saut√© the lobster in batches, about
one minute each, adding butter as necessary.

Add the lobster to the potatoes and raise the heat to medium. Add the
evaporated milk and basil, adjusting salt and pepper as desired. Cut
with cream if the soup is too thick.

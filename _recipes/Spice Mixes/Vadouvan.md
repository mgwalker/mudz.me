## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment
paper.

In a food processor, working in 3 batches, coarsely chop the onions;
transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with the shallots and garlic, chopping
them separately and adding them to the onions.

In a large deep nonstick skillet, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the
onion mixture and cook over high heat, stirring often, until golden and
browned in spots, 25 to 30 minutes.

In a spice mill or mortar, grind the fenugreek seeds. Stir into the
onion mixture along with the remaining ingredients. Scrape onto the
prepared baking sheet and spread in a thin even layer. Bake, stirring
occasionally with a skewer to separate the onions, for about 1 hour,
until deeply browned and barely moist.

## Ingredients

* 3 medium vanilla beans
* 1 cup vodka

## Directions

Using a sharp knife, slice the beans open lengthwise to expose the
seeds. Place the beans in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, and cover with
vodka. Place the lid on the jar and shake a few times. Place in a cool,
dark place for eight weeks, shaking occasionally.

## Ingredients

* 8 white potatoes, cubed
* 3 carrots, chopped
* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1/2 onion
* 2 Tablespoons ginger paste
* 2 Tablespoons garlic paste
* 1 Tablespoon garam masala
* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 28 ounces crushed tomatoes
* 1/2 cup vegetable broth
* 2 Tablespoons honey
* [1/3]{.s2} cup plain yogurt
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

Preheat your oven to 425Â° F. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the
potatoes and carrots. Cook for 8 minutes. Transfer the potatoes and
carrots to a bowl and toss with olive oil. Place the oiled vegetables on
a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 20 minutes,
toss, and bake for another 15 minutes.

While the vegetables are roasting, combine the garam masala, cardamom,
turmeric, paprika, coriander, cumin, chili powder, and cinnamon in a
small bowl. Heat a large pan with butter over medium-high heat. Add the
onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and
ginger paste and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the spice
mixture and mix until well combined.

Add the crushed tomatoes and vegetable broth. Mix well, making sure
there are no clumps of spices left. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the yogurt
and honey. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Add the
roasted vegetables. Serve with saffron rice.

## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
* 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* sliced Monterrey Jack cheese

## Directions

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Place the ground turkey, onion, chipotle chile pepper, garlic powder,
onion powder, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a mixing bowl; mix
well. Form into patties.

Cook the hamburgers on the preheated grill until the turkey is no longer
pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Place cheese slices on the
patties 2 minutes before they are ready. Serve on toasted buns.

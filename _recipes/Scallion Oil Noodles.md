title: Scallion Oil Noodles
---

## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons oil
* 2 stalks scallion, cut into small rounds
* 8 oz fresh noodles
* 1 Tablespoon oyster sauce
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce or to taste

## Directions

Heat up a wok with the cooking oil until it begins to smoke. Add the
scallion and stir continuously with the spatula until the scallion is
aromatic and becomes moderately burned. (This process will release the
full fragrance of the scallion and infuses the scallion oil with the
intense aroma.) Set aside the scallion oil.

Heat up a pot of water until it boils. Cook the fresh noodles al dente.
The noodles should be cooked through but still somewhat firm and
springy. Drain the noodles and transfer into a serving bowl.

Add the scallion oil, oyster sauce, and soy sauce into the noodles.
Using a pair of chopsticks, toss the noodles to blend well with the
scallion oil and seasoning sauces. Serve immediately.

title: Falafel
---

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas
* 1/2 a large onion, quartered
* 2 to 4 garlic cloves, peeled
* a handful of fresh parsley
* a handful of chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 teaspoon salt or more to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* Peanut or vegetable oil for frying

## Directions

The night before: cover the chickpeas in water with a half Tablespoon of
salt added. Let chickpeas soak overnight.

When ready to make the falafel, chop the onion, garlic and fresh herbs
in the food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, but not a paste. Add
the soaked chickpeas, salt and cumin. Pulse in the food processor until
the mixture is thick and somewhat chunky. Transfer to a bowl and cover.
Let the mixture rest in the fridge for at least a half hour, longer if
possible.

Heat about an inch of oil in a heavy-bottomed pan, to between 350° F and
375° F.

Form the falafel mixture into balls or small patties about 1-2 inches
around. Squeeze them tightly so they hold together. Use a slotted spoon
to drop them into the heated oil, about 4 at a time. Adjust heat to
account for the drop in temperature when the falafel is added.

Fry until golden brown all around, flipping as needed (about 3-5
minutes). Remove with slotted spoon, and place on paper towels. Serve
immediately.

## Directions

Preheat barbecue grill to high heat.

Rub the chicken breast with some vegetable oil then grill it on the
barbecue for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until done. Lightly salt and
pepper each side of the chicken while it cooks. Set chicken aside until
it cools down enough to handle.

Preheat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a medium-size skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the red pepper and onion to the pan and sautee for
a couple minutes until tender.

Dice the cooked chicken into small cubes and add it to the pan. Add the
corn, black beans, spinach, jalapeño peppers, parsley, cumin, chili
powder, salt, and cayenne pepper to the pan. Cook for another 4 minutes.
Stir well so that the spinach separates and is incorporated into the
mixture. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese. Stir until the
cheese is melted.

Wrap the tortillas in a moist cloth and microwave on high temperature
for 1 1/2 minutes or until hot. Spoon approximately one-fifth of the
mixture into the center of a tortilla. Fold in the ends and then roll
the tortilla over the mixture. Roll the tortilla very tight, then pierce
with a toothpick to hold together. Repeat with the remaining ingredients
until you have five egg rolls. Arrange the egg rolls on a plate, cover
the plate with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours. Overnight
is best.

While the egg rolls freeze prepare the avocado-ranch dipping sauce by
combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Preheat 4-6 cups of
oil to 375°F.



Deep fry the egg rolls in the hot oil for 12-15 minutes and remove to
paper towels or a rack to drain for about 2 minutes. Slice each egg roll
diagonally lengthwise and arrange on a plate around a small bowl of the
dipping sauce. Garnish the dipping sauce with the chopped tomato and
onion.

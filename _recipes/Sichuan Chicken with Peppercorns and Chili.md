title: Sichuan Chicken with Peppercorns and Chili
---

## Ingredients

* 3 chicken thighs, skin-on, about 12 ounces
* 1/2 teapoons salt
* 2 teaspoons light soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 1 tablespoon water
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1/2 inch chunk of ginger, thinly sliced
* About 10 dried red chillies
* 1 teaspoon whole Sichuan peppercorns
* 1 bell pepper, cut into 1/2 inch squares

## Directions

Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch cubes. Mix together the salt, soy sauce,
rice wine, cornstarch, and water. Add the chicken and stir to coat. Set
aside.

Heat wok over high heat. Add 1/3 cup oil and place all of the chicken
into the oil, stirring gently to fry the meat. Cook until chicken is
lightly browned, then remove the chicken from the oil and set aside.
Pour off a few tablespoons of the oil; leave about 3 tablespoons left in
the wok.

Heat the wok over high heat until it\'s almost smoking. When the oil is
hot but not smoking, add the chillies and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry
for a few seconds until they are fragrant, taking care not to burn them.

Add the green bell peppers to the wok and stir-fry until they are
tender-crisp.

Add the chicken back to the wok and continue to stir-fry for 30 seconds,
until the ingredients are well-combined. Serve immediately.

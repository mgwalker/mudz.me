title: Garlic Sesame Sticks
---

## Ingredients

* ½ cup Oats ( I used the quick cooking)
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp Butter (add more if you prefer crispy sticks, see Note below)
* ¼ cup Sesame seeds
* 1 tsp green chilli paste (optional)
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp sugar
* Salt per taste
* ½ tsp Baking Powder
* ½ cup water

## Directions

Note: If you prefer a crisper version, then add an extra tablespoon or
two of butter and that will definitely make this crunchy. In fact, if
you are trying this for the first time, then I highly recommend adding 4
Tbsp of butter instead of 2 Tbsp.

Preheat the oven to 325 F.

Coarsely powder the oats, then take a big plate and add the rest of the
dry ingredients including sesame seeds and mix well. Melt the butter and
add to the above mixture. This will form a bread crumb like consistency.
Add water little by little and knead to stiff dough. Keep it aside for
30 minutes.

Divide the dough into 5 portions. Take small balls of dough and place it
in between 2 greased plastic sheets. Apply pressure and make it into
flat disc. Remove the top cover and with the tip of your hands flatten
the dough and make it as flat as possible.

Using a knife cut into small strips. Repeat this process with the
remaining dough as well. Place the strips on a greased cookie sheet.
Bake for about 10 minutes until they are light brown. Turn them over and
bake for another 10 minutes. Allow to cool before snacking!

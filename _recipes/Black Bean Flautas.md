title: Black Bean Flautas
---

## Ingredients

* 1 15 oz. can black beans, with liquid
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon salt, divided
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* juice of half a lime
* 1 cup tomatoes, seeded and chopped
* 1 cup thinly sliced green onions
* 2 1/2 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese
* 10 flour tortillas

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 450°F.

Pour the beans into a medium saucepan, along with the vegetable broth,
garlic, cumin, chili powder, and half the salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce
heat and simmer 10 minutes, or until the beans are very soft. Drain,
reserving the liquid. Place the beans in a blender along with the lime
juice and remaining salt, and purée until smooth. If the beans are too
dry, add the reserved liquid by Tablespoons.

Spread 1-2 Tablespoons of the bean purée in each tortilla. Sprinkle with
cheese, tomatoes, and green onions. Roll up very tightly and place
seam-side down in a 13" x 9" baking dish. Bake 10-15 minutes, or until
crisp and brown.

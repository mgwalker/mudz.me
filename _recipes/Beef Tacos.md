## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef

## Directions

Heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the beef and onion to the
pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the beef is browned

to coat. Cook until water is reduced, about 2 minutes.

Serve in warm taco shells with desired toppings.

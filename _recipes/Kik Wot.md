## Ingredients

* 1 yellow onion, minced
* 1 red onion, minced
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 2 Tablespoons berbere
* 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup dried red lentils
* 2 cups water
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## DIrections

Place the onions and garlic in a medium saucepan over medium heat; cook
and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the berbere and cook
another 3 minutes. Stir in the oil and cook another 3 minutes more.

Stir in the crushed tomatoes and cook until they start to break down
into the stew, about 15 minutes. Stir in the lentils and cook another 5
minutes. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and
simmer until the lentils are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Season
the stew with the cardamom, salt, and ground black pepper in the last
few minutes of cooking.

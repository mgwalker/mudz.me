title: Emergency Kimchi
---

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds Napa cabbage
* 1 cup cold water
* 1/4 cup salt
* 1/3 cup hot pepper flakes
* 1 Tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 cup fish sauce,
* 1/4 cup minced garlic,
* 3-4 stalks of chopped green onion
* 1/4 cup julienned carrot

## Directions

Cut the cabbage into thin strips. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage,
water, and salt, and mix well. Set aside for at least ten minutes.

Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl to make a kimchi paste.

Wash and rinse the cabbage in cold water, and drain. Add the kimchi
paste to the cabbage and mix thoroughly. Store in an airtight container
or plastic bag, pressing the top of the kimchi down with your hands to
protect it from being exposed to too much air.

Eat it right away, just like salad. Or keep it at room temperature and
it will ferment in a few days.

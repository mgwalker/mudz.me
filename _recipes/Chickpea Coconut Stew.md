title: Chickpea Coconut Stew
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound dried chickpeas, soaked overnight
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 1 2-inch piece ginger, finely chopped
* Salt and pepper
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 2 15-ounce cans coconut milk
* 2 cups chicken stock
* 1 bunch Swiss chard or kale, stemmed and chopped
* 1 cup mint leaves

## Directions

In a medium pot, add the chickpeas and cover with two inches of water.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer until tender, about
2 hours. Drain.

Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, and
ginger. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally,
until the onion is translucent and begins to brown.

Ad the turmeric, red pepper flakes, and chickpeas, and season with salt
and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the chickpeas start break
down, 8-10 minutes. Remove about a cup of the chickpeas and set aside.

Using a spoon, crush the remaining chickpeas. Add the coconut milk and
stock to the pot, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and
cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 30-35
minutes.

Add the greens and stir through. Cook until softened, 3-7 minutes. Turn
off the heat, add the reserved chickpeas and mint leaves, and stir
through. Serve.

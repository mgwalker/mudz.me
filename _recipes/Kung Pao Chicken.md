## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 boneless & skinless chicken breast, cubed
* 3 Tablespoons roasted peanuts
* 8-12 dried red chilies, deseeded and cut into halves
* 3 Tablespoons cooking oil
* 5 slices peeled fresh ginger
* 2 cloves garlic, sliced diagonally
* 1 scallion, chopped

### Marinade

* 1 Tablespoon corn starch
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1 Tablespoon Shaoxing wine
* 1 teaspoon oil

### Sauce

* 3 Tablespoons light soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon black vinegar
* 4 Tablespoons water
* 2 teaspoons corn starch

## Directions

Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl and add the chicken. Set
aside and leave for 30 minutes. Mix the sauce ingredients in a small
bowl and set aside.

Heat up a wok with one tablespoon cooking oil and stir-fry the marinated
chicken until they are 70% cooked. Dish out and set aside.

Clean the wok and add in the remaining 2 Tablespoons of cooking oil
until it smokes. Add in the ginger and garlic slices and do a quick stir
before adding in the dried red chilies.

Stir fry the dried red chilies until aromatic and they smell spicy, then
add in the chicken meat. Do a quick stir before adding in the roasted
peanuts and continue to stir a few times. Add in the sauce and stir
continuously until the chicken meat is nicely coated with the sauce. Add
in the scallions and stir evenly.

Dish out and serve hot with steamed white rice.

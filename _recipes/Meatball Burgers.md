## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage
* 1/2 pound ground beef or veal
* 1 14 oz. can Italian tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon tomato paste
* 1 small onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 teaspoon marjoram
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 ball fresh mozzarella, cut into 8 slices
* Olive oil

## Directions

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, and saute the onion, garlic, and
marjoram until transparent. Remove half the onion mixture to a large
bowl. To the pan, add the tomatoes and tomato paste, season with salt
and pepper, cover, and simmer 30 minutes to an hour, stirring
occasionally.

To the remaining onion mixture, add the meat, parsley, breadcrumbs, egg
yolks, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper, and mix
well. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Form the meat into thick patties roughly the
diameter of a hamburger bun. Heat some olive oil in a skillet and brown
the patties on both sides. Transfer the patties to a baking dish. Pour
over the tomato sauce over the patties, cover with foil, and bake 30
minutes.

After 30 minutes, remove the foil, place a slice of mozzarella over each
patty, and return to the oven. Bake another five minutes. Serve on
toasted hamburger buns.

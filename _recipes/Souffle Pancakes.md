## Ingredients


### Pancakes

* 5 ½ cups flour
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 tablespoon baking powder[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 tablespoon baking soda[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 2 cups milk
* 2 1/2 cups buttermilk
* 2 whole eggs
* 2 eggs yolks
* 3 egg whites

### Caramel Sauce

* 1 banana, mashed[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 tablespoon butter[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

## Directions

[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine dry
ingredients in large mixing bowl.

[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}Combine milk, whole eggs, and egg yolks and
whisk together in medium mixing bowl. Slowly stir into dry ingredients
to prevent lumps. Do not over mix (this makes the pancakes tough).

[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}Whisk egg whites to medium peak. Fold gently
into batter. Do not over mix.

[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}Melt a tablespoon of butter in a six-inch
non-stick frying pan on medium. Swirl to coat sides. Butter should be
golden and bubbling, but not brown or smoking. Pour one cup of batter
into pan. You can add more or less depending on how thick you want the
pancake. It will puff up so don\'t fill pan more than ¾ of the way up
the sides. Cook on the stovetop for one minute then place in the oven
for 3 minutes. Flip pancake and place back into oven for approximately
two more minutes or until cooked through. Add more butter as necessary
to coat pan and repeat. Serve with maple syrup, sliced fruit, whipped
cream and syrup or caramel banana sauce.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

[Caramel Sauce]{.s1}

Slowly brown the butter on a low heat in a medium saucepan. Stir in the
remaining ingredients. Cook until sauce thickens slightly.

## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 1 Tablespoon whole milk
* 1/4 large onion, diced
* 1 green chile, diced
* 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon chile powder
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 pinch salt, to taste
* 1 splash canola oil, for frying

## Directions

In a large bowl, whisk together all the ingredients except the
oil.[Â ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Heat the oil in a pan over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, turn
the heat down and add half the omelet mixture to the pan, swirling it
around so that it completely covers the surface of the pan.

Cook the omelet for two minutes, until the underside is lightly browned.
Flip the omelet and cook the other side for another two minutes, until
browned. Set aside, and repeat with the remaining omelet mixture.

title: Rye and Fennel Rolls
---

## Ingredients


### Dough

* 300 grams strong white bread flour
* 200 grams dark rye flour
* 10 grams Salt
* 7 grams dried yeast
* 1 Tablespoon black treacle (molasses or dark corn syrup)
* 1 Tablespoon oil
* 1 dessert spoonful fennel seed
* 280-300ml water

### Crust

* 60 grams rice flour
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon yeast
* 1 Tablespoon sesame oil
* water

## Directions

Either by hand or using the dough hook of a machine mix together the
dough ingredients and adding between 280 ad 300ml water, sufficient to
form a dough. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic --
this will take around 10 minutes in a machine and 15-20 minutes by hand.

Grease a roomy mixing bowl and pop the dough into it then cover with
clingfilm and allow to double in size. This will take around an hour in
a warm place.

Whilst the dough is rising mix the crust ingredients. Simply place all
the ingredients into a small bowl then add sufficient water to form a
thick paste.[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}Set aside.

When the bread has risen take from the bowl and divide into 12 equal
pieces -- each one should be around 70g each.

Shape the rolls and place on one or two baking sheets. Take the paste
and using the hands gently cover each roll with a layer.[

layer of white bread flour.[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}Leave to prove
uncovered in a warm place for one and a half hours. During the prove the
tops will start to crack as they rise and look quite interesting.

Heat the oven to 425° F and after the long prove pop into the oven and
bake for 20 minutes until browned and crispy on the top.

title: Sweet and Sour Pork Noodles
---

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces egg noodles
* 4 ounces pork, sliced into thin pieces
* 2 Tablespoons oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 ounces bean sprouts, roots removed (optional)
* 1 Tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste

### Marinade

* 1/2 Tablespoon soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
* 2 dashes white pepper
* 1 teaspoon garlic chili sauce
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar

## Directions

Boil the egg noodles until al dente. Rinse quickly with cold water,
drained dry and set aside.

Marinate the pork with all the ingredients in the Marinade, for 15
minutes.

Heat up the oil in a wok or skillet. When the oil is heated, add the
garlic and stir fry until aromatic. Add the pork into the wok, stir and
cook until they are almost cooked. Add the bean sprouts, followed by the
noodles. Add the soy sauce. Stir to combine well with noodles and all
the ingredients in the wok or skillet. When the bean sprouts are wilted
and cooked but remain crunchy, the dish is ready to be served.

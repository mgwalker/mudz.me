---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup white wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 pound red or green seedless grapes

## Directions

Combine the white wine vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, black peppercorns,
salt, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes.

Remove a sliver from the stem end of each grape. Place the grapes in a
1-quart jar and carefully pour vinegar mixture over the grapes. Seal and
refrigerate at least 1 hour, or overnight.

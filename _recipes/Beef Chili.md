title: Beef Chili
---

## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3 pounds beef shoulder, cut into large cubes
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 Tablespoons ancho chili powder
* 1 Tablespoon ground coriander
* 1 Tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 Tablespoon sweet paprika
* 1 Tablespoon dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 onions, diced
* 10 garlic cloves, halved
* 3 canned chipotle peppers in adobo, chopped
* 1 jalapeño, seeded and chopped
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed by hand
* 1/2 cup masa harina

## Directions

In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil. Season the beef shoulder all
over with salt and pepper, add it to the pot and brown it. As it\'s
browning stir in the chili powder, coriander, cumin, paprika, oregano
and cinnamon. Lower the temperature under the meat to \"toast\" the
spices. In a food processor puree the onions, garlic, chipotle peppers,
jalapeño, tomato paste and sugar and add it to the pot. Increase the
heat to medium to steam vegetables a little and sweeten the peppers. Add
enough water to cover by 1 inch, about 1 quart, and add tomatoes with
their liquid. Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that rises to the
surface. Reduce the heat and simmer until the meat is fork-tender and
comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours. As it cooks down, add
more water, if necessary. Whisk the masa harina with liquid from the
chili and stir back into the pot. Take a potato masher and mash the
chili so the meat comes apart in shreds. Season with salt and pepper, to
taste. Garnish each serving with shredded cheddar, chives, and sour
cream.

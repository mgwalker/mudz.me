title: Chicken Consomme
---

## Ingredients

* 6 cups unsalted, homemade chicken stock or prepared chicken stock, cold
* 1 small leek, well washed, trimmed and minced
* 1 small carrot, grated
* 3 fresh parsley sprigs, minced
* 8 ounces ground chicken breast
* 2 egg whites
* kosher salt

## Directions

Put the stock in a large saucepan.

Stir together the leek, carrot, and parsley in bowl of a food processor.
Add the ground chicken, egg whites, and 2 Tablespoons water. Pulse to
mix well. Stir this mixture into the stock in pot.

Bring the stock very slowly to the boil, stirring constantly. The egg
mixture will congeal and form a \"raft\" on the top of the stock,
collecting all the impurities from the stock. As soon as it begins to
boil, stop stirring and turn the heat down to low. A hole will have
formed on the top of the \"raft\". Make it slightly larger with a spoon,
and then simmer the stock very gently for 45 minutes. Remove the pot
from the heat and let stand 5 minutes.

Line a sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth. Using a skimmer, lift
off as much egg white from the top of the consommé as you can, and
discard. Ladle the consommé into the lined strainer and let it drip
through in its own good time. Don\'t be tempted to press it or you\'ll
make it cloudy.

When it has all dripped through, season and taste the consommé. Season
the consommé with salt, if needed. Serve hot or cold with the garnish of
your choice.

title: Rhubarb Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups diced rhubarb
* 3 Tablespoons granulated sugar
* 2 Tablespoons water
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Directions

In a small pot, combine the rhubarb, sugar, water, and salt. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the rhubarb breaks down and the mixture is jammy, 5 - 15 minutes. Remove the rhubarb jam from the heat and stir in the lemon juice.

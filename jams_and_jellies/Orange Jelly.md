## Ingredients

* Flesh of 1 orange 
* 90 grams sugar 
* 75 milliliters water 
* 1 sheet leaf gelatine 
* Red/yellow food color 
* 1 Tablespoon cointreau

## Directions

Chop up the orange flesh and place in a saucepan with the 90 grams sugar
and 75 milliliters water. Stir over a gentle heat until the sugar
dissolves then bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Put the sheet
of gelatin in a jug of cold water to soften for 10 minutes.


Blend the cooked orange mixture with a hand blender until fairly smooth,
then to enrich the jelly appearance, add a couple of drops of red and
yellow food color. Finally add 1 Tablespoon cointreau and the sheet of
gelatin. Leave to cool and firm up.

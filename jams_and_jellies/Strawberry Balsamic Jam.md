title: Strawberry Balsamic Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound strawberries, hulled and chopped
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 Tablespoon balsamic vinegar

## Directions

In a large bowl mix together strawberries, lemon juice and sugar. Let
the strawberries sit for at least 4 hours or up to overnight to macerate
and release their juices.

Transfer the strawberries to a pot and stir in the balsamic vinegar.
Slowly bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often to
prevent sticking. Cook until thickened, about 20 minutes.

Pour into four 1/2-pint jars and process in a water bath for 10 minutes.
Remove and cool.

title: Pear Honey
---

## Ingredients

* 3 pounds pears, peeled and cored
* 1 8-ounce can crushed pineapple
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 box Sure-Jell
* 5 cups sugar
* red and green maraschino cherries, rinsed and chopped (optional)

## Directions

Place a small saucer in the freezer.

Chop the pears, then combine them with the sugar, Sure-Jell, lemon juice, and pineapple in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and simmer until the pears are tender, about 15 minutes. Once tender, mash the pears with a potato masher or large spoon, then bring to a rolling boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then spoon a small portion of jam onto the cold saucer to test. If the jam runs when you tilt the saucer, continue boiling another 5 minutes.

When the jam is set, turn off the heat, stir in the cherries, and pour into sterile jars.

title: Plum Jam
---

## Ingredients

* 4 pounds pitted black or elephant heart plums, cut into quarters
* 1 1/2 pounds granulated sugar
* 1 Tablespoon Pomona\'s Universal Pectin (optional)
* 4 teaspoons calcium water
* 1 teaspoon unsalted butter

## Directions

Combine the plums, sugar, and pectin in a large bowl and toss. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 24 hours.

Place a few metal spoons in the freezer. Transfer plum mixture to a
large, wide pot and stir in calcium water. Cook over medium heat,
stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Simmer until plums are
mostly softened, about 15 minutes. For a smoother jam, place a food mill
over a bowl and ladle a few cups of the mixture into it. Mill the
mixture into the bowl. Repeat until roughly half the plums have been
milled, then stir the milled plums back into the pot.

Continue to cook until mixture starts to foam. Scrape off and discard
foam with a metal spoon. Stir in butter. Continue to cook, stirring
occasionally to prevent scorching, until foaming has subsided, about 15
minutes longer. Continue to cook, stirring more frequently, until jam is
glossy, about 10 minutes longer.

To test for doneness, spoon a small amount of jam onto one of the frozen
spoons and return to freezer for 5 minutes. Remove from freezer and
check consistency. The jam is ready when it\'s spreadable, but not
runny. Cook until this texture is reached.

Transfer jam into washed and rinsed mason jars. Seal jars and place in a
canner. Boil for 10 minutes, then remove and leave to cool.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup walnuts pieces
* 1/2 cup non-fat yogurt
* 2 Tablespoons light mayonnaise
* 2 Tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 1 teaspoon honey
* 1/2 lemon, zest finely grated
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 2 large crisp apples, such as Gala
* 2 ribs celery (with leaves), sliced (leaves chopped)
* 1/4 cup golden raisins
* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 1 head Boston lettuce, trimmed, washed, and dried

## Directions

Whisk the yogurt, mayonnaise, parsley, honey, and lemon zest in a large
bowl and season generously with pepper.

Halve, core, and cut the apples into 3/4-inch pieces, leaving the skin
intact. Add the apples, celery and raisins to the bowl, and sprinkle
with the lemon juice; then toss with the dressing. Cover and refrigerate
if not serving immediately.

When ready to serve, toss walnuts into the salad. Arrange the lettuce
leaves on a large platter, or divide them among 4 salad plates. Place
the salad on the lettuce and serve.

---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup wild rice
* 3 1/2 cups chicken stock
* 2 pounds butternut squash, diced
* 1 Tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 3 Tablespoons walnut oil
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chives, tarragon)
* 1/2 cup diced celery
* 5 - 6 ounces arugula or spinach
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

Bring the stock to a boil in a medium saucepan, then add the rice and
salt to taste. Return to a boil, cover, and reduce to a simmer for 45
minutes. Drain and set aside.

Heat the oven to 425Â° F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss the squash
with the balsamic vinegar, 1 Tablespoon of oil, and salt and pepper to
taste. Spread on the baking sheet in a single layer and roast 20 - 30
minutes. Set aside.

In a measuring cup, whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, mustard,
remaining olive oil, walnut oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

In a large bowl, combine the rice, squash, herbs, and celery. Toss with
dressing and season with salt and pepper. Combine with the arugula just
before serving.

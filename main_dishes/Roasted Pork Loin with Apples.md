title: Roasted Pork Loin with Apples
---

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1 (2-pound) boneless center cut pork loin, trimmed and tied
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 medium onion, thickly sliced
* 2 carrots, thickly sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, smashed
* 3 sprigs fresh thyme
* 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 4 Tablespoons cold unsalted butter
* 2 apples, such as Cortland or Rome peeled, cored and cut into 8 slices

### Sauce

* 2 Tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 1 cup apple cider
* 2 Tablespoons whole grain mustard

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 400° F.

In a large ovenproof skillet heat the oil over high heat. Season the
pork loin all over generously with salt and pepper. Sear the meat until
golden brown on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the
meat to a plate and set it aside.

Add the onion, carrot, garlic, herb sprigs, and 2 Tablespoons of the
butter to the skillet. Stir until the vegetables are browned, about 8
minutes. Stir in the sliced apples, then push the mixture to the sides
and set the pork loin in the middle of the skillet along with any
collected juices on the plate. Transfer the skillet to the oven and
roast the loin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the
center of the meat registers 140° F to 150° F, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Transfer the pork a cutting board and cover it loosely with foil while
you make the sauce. Arrange the apples and vegetables on a serving
platter and set aside. Remove and discard the herb sprigs. Return the
skillet to a high heat and add the vinegar scraping the bottom with a
wooden spoon to loosen up any browned bits. Reduce by half then add the
cider and reduce by about half again. Pull the skillet from the heat and
whisk in the mustard, and the remaining 2 Tablespoons of cold butter.
Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.

Remove the strings from the roast and slice into 1/2-inch thick pieces
and arrange over the apple mixture. Drizzle some sauce over meat and
serve the rest on the side.

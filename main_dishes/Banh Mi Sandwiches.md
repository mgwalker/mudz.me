## Ingredients


### Marinade

* 2 pounds boneless pork butt, cut into 1/4-inch slices
* 1/2 cup minced lemongrass
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 3 Tablespoons fish sauce
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons ground black pepper
* 5 shallots, peeled and minced
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 Tablespoons roasted sesame oil
* 2 Tablespoons peanut oil/regular cooking oil
* 2 Tablespoons sweet soy sauce

### Sandwich

* 4-6 8-inch baguette rolls, sliced lengthwise in the center
* 1/2 bunch cilantro leaves
* 5 jalape√±o chilies, deseeded and thinly sliced
* pickled carrots and daikon (store-bought or homemade)
* mayonnaise

## Directions

Lightly pound the pork slices with a mallet. In a large bowl, mix all
the marinade ingredients well. Put in the pork slices and marinate for
about 1-2 hours, or overnight. Discard excess marinade before use.

Heat grill until ready to use. Gently arrange marinated pork slices onto
the grill. Grill until the pork is nicely charred on both sides and meat
is thoroughly cooked. If using an indoor broiler oven, broil for 5-7
minutes on each side or until the meat is completely cooked and nicely
charred.

Assemble the sandwiches and serve immediately.

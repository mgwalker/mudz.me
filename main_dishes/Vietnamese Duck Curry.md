## Ingredients

* 10 small cloves garlic, chopped
* 4 stalks lemongrass, pounded and thinly sliced
* 2 onions, chopped
* 1 Fresno chile or jalapeño
* 1 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 Tablespoons Thai red curry paste
* 1 Tablespoon salt
* 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
* 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 13 1/2 ounce cans coconut milk
* 5 cups duck stock
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
* 2 Tablespoons fish sauce
* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
* 2 Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 duck breasts
* 2 confit duck legs 
* 24 fresh Thai basil leaves, plus more to garnish
* 1 bunch green onions, sliced 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

In a blender or food processor, combine the garlic, lemongrass, onions, chile, ginger, curry paste, salt and peppercorns. Blend or process until very smooth.

Heat the vegetable oil in a medium pot set over medium heat. Add the curry mixture and cook 10 minutes, or until the color darkens and flavors deepen. Stir in the coconut milk and duck stock. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 1 hour, or until reduced by half. Season with sugar and fish sauce.

Meanwhile, heat oven to 425°F. Arrange the potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet, toss with 1 Tablespoon of the olive oil, and roast for 30 - 40 minutes, or until tender.

Using a sharp knife, score the skin of the duck breast diagonally in both directions to create a diamond pattern, being careful not to cut the flesh. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining Tablespoon of oil in a medium sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the duck breasts, skin side down, and sear until the skin is golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. The meat will not be fully cooked. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Slice 1/4-inch thick.

Add the duck leg confit and taro root to the curry and simmer until warmed through. Add the duck breast and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the meat is medium-rare. Turn off the heat, then fold in the Thai basil and green onions. Serve with rice.

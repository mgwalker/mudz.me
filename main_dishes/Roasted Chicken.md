title: Roasted Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken, 4-7 lbs
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 lemon
* 1 onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, halved
* Thyme sprigs
* Tarragon sprigs
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Black pepper

## Directions

The night before roasting, remove any organs from the cavity of the chicken, the generously salt the skin and cavity. Return to the refrigerator overnight.

Heat oven to 425° F.

Cut 6 thin slices out of the middle of the lemon.

Gently separate the skin from the breasts of the chicken. Stuff a bay leaf and 3 slices of lemon below the skin over each breast. Fill the cavity of the chicken with the onion, garlic, thyme, tarragon, and the ends of the lemon. Massage olive oil into the skin on all sides, then season generously with salt and black pepper.

Roast in the oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thighs reads 160° F, about 50 minutes.

Remove from the oven and allow to rest at least 15 minutes before carving.

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon safflower oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 pound dried pinto beans
* 3 1/2 cups water
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ancho chile powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
* 1 poblano, seeded and chopped
* 1 Tablespoon lime juice
* Cotija cheese, cubed
* Avocado, diced
* Cilantro, diced
* Tortilla chips

## Directions

In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over medium-low. Add the onion  and poblano to the pot and while stirring occasionally, cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 more seconds. Add the beans, water chile powder, cumin, oregano, salt, bay, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat low and simmer until the beans are tender, 2 - 3 hours. Allow to cool slightly, then pour into a blender, in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth. Return to the pot and return to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat, stir in the lime juice, and adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve warm topped with cotija, avocado, cilantro, and crushed tortilla chips.

title: Waffles

## Ingredients

* 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the waffle iron
* 240 grams all-purpose flour
* 15 grams sugar
* 4 grams baking powder
* 5 grams fine sea salt
* 3 grams baking soda
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1 cup milk
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla
* 4 large eggs

## Directions

Melt the butter either on the stove or in the microwave. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, milk, vanilla, melted butter, and eggs. Fold the wet ingredients into dry ingredients.

Heat a waffle iron and, using a pastry brush or paper towel, lightly coat with butter. Using 1/2 cup batter for each waffle, cook until golden and crisp. Butter the iron in between batches as needed. Serve the waffles immediately as they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200Â° F oven until ready to serve.

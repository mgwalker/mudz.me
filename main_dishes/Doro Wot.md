## Ingredients

* 1 cup butter, divided

* 2â€‰1/2 cups water, divided
* 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
* 3/4 cup berbere

## Directions

Heat 1/2 cup butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir
onion until translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and tomato
paste; stir until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining butter,
berbere, garlic, and ginger. Adjust heat to low and cook until mixture
thickens to paste consistency, 20 to 30 minutes.

hard-boiled eggs. Cook until sauce is reduced slightly, about 15 minutes

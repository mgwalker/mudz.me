---

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes
* 3 chipotle chile peppers in adobo
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 pound Mexican chorizo, removed from its casing
* 1 1/2 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 cups water
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, plus more for serving
* 1 Tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice
* Warm corn tortillas, for serving
* 1 avocado, peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced, for serving
* Cotija cheese, for serving
* 1 lime cut into wedges, for serving

## Directions

Heat the oven to 300Â°F.

In a Dutch oven, heat 1 Tablespoon of the oil on medium-low heat. Add
the onion and garlic and while occasionally stirring, cook until
fragrant and softened, about 4 minutes. Scrape the onion and garlic into
a blender and add the tomatoes, chipotle chiles, oregano, and thyme.
Blend until smooth.

Meanwhile, wipe out the Dutch oven and then add the remaining oil and
the chorizo removed from its casing. On medium heat, while occasionally
stirring cook for 10 minutes or until the meat has darkened.

Turn off the heat and add to the Dutch oven the pork shoulder, bay leaf,
salt, chipotle tomato salsa from the blender, and water. Gently stir to
combine everything, cover the pot, and then bake for 2- 2 1/2 hours or
until the sauce has reduced and the pork is fork tender and can be
easily shredded.

Once the pork is tender, with two forks, shred the pork and then stir in
the chopped cilantro and lime juice. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve
warm with corn tortillas with more cilantro, avocado, Cotija cheese, and
lime wedges, on the side.

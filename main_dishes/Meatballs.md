## Ingredients

* 2 bread slices
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 pound ground beef

* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Heat the oven to 350°F.

Soak the bread in the milk until soggy. Squeeze the milk from the bread
and combine the bread gently with the meat, onion, garlic, parmesan,
parsley, salt, and pepper. Shape into 1-inch meatballs, pressing no more

Sauté the meatballs in in olive oil in batches until lightly browned on
all sides. Transfer to baking sheet. Bake at 350°F until done through,

## Ingredients

* 2 Tablespoons grapeseed oil
* 1 large yellow onion, chopped
* 6 garlic cloves, sliced
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 8 cups chicken stock
* 2 pounds chicken leg quarters
* 1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, husked and rinsed
* 4 poblano chiles
* 3 serrano chiles
* 2 Cubanelle peppers, or 2 more poblanos
* 2 Tablespoons orange juice
* 2 15-ounce cans golden or white hominy, rinsed
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 1 cup cilantro leaves with tender stems
* 1 Tablespoon lime juice

## Directions

Heat the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium. Cook the yellow onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until very tender, 12–15 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, and oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicken and stock, bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered and reducing heat as needed to maintain a very gentle simmer, until chicken is cooked through, 40–50 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat oven to 425◦ F. Spread the tomatillos, poblanos, serranos, and Cubanelles on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast, tossing once or twice, until the tomatillos are tender and the peppers are browned and collapsing, 30–40 minutes. Let cool.

Remove the chicken from the pot, keeping the pot on simmer, and leaving the chicken to cool. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken and discard the bones.

Split open the chiles and discard the stems and seeds. Discard any skin that can be easily peeled off; otherwise, just leave it on. Reserve the baking sheet. Purée the tomatillos and chiles in a blender until smooth. Stir the purée into the simmering, along with the orange juice.

Spread the hominy in an even layer on the reserved baking sheet and roast, tossing once, until lightly toasted, very fragrant, and just beginning to brown around edges of the baking sheet, 12–18 minutes. Scrape into the pot with the broth.

Simmer the stock, uncovered and seasoning with salt and pepper as needed, until the flavors meld and the stock is rich tasting, about 20 minutes. Ladle 1/2 cup of broth into a blender. Add 2 cups of cilantro and purée until smooth and very bright green, at least 1 minute. Stir the chicken into the broth and heat through, followed by the cilantro purée and lime juice. Serve hot.

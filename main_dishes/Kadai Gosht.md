## Directions

Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the mutton and cook until browned on
all sides.

Season with turmeric and salt, then add the onions and tomatoes. Cook,

tomatoes have broken down, at least 40 minutes.

Add the remaining ingredients and stir through. Return to a boil and
simmer until the curry takes on the desired consistency.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion, diced
* 8 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 large fresh tomatoes, chopped
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced
* 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
* 1 Tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons berbere
* 1 Tablespoon smoked paprika
* 1 Tablespoon ground coriander seeds
* 1 15-ounce can of tomato sauce
* 1 cup water
* 2 Tablespoons dried oregano
* 2 Tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 box lasagna noodles
* 4 cups shredded mozzarella, divided
* 2 cups shredded orange cheddar
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan

## Directions

Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or a Dutch oven over medium heat.
Add the onions and allow them to sweat for about 3 minutes, then stir in
the tomatoes, garlic, and green onions. Cook for 3-5 more minutes. Add the beef
to the pot, being careful to break up clumps with a wooden spoon. Add salt
and pepper to taste, then cook until the meat is browned, about 10 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and berbere to the pot; allow to cook for 5 minutes before
adding the tomato sauce, water, paprika, coriander, bay leaves, oregano, and basil.
Reduce the heat and simmer for up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add water as necessary
to prevent the sauce from drying out and scorching.

Heat the oven to 375Â° F. Boil lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside.

Immediately before beginning to layer the lasagna, remove the bay leaves
and stir 1 cup of mozzarella directly into the sauce mix.

Ladle the meat sauce mixture directly into the pan, spreading to cover
the bottom evenly. Follow with a layer of noodles, then sauce, then both the
mozzarella and cheddar. Continue alternating until the lasagna is
constructed. Sprinkle parmesan over the top layer of mozzarella and
cheddar, then cover the lasagna aluminumfoil. Bake covered for 45 minutes, 
then remove foil and bake for another 15 minutes or until a significant portion 
of the top cheese layer has browned. Allow to cool at least 10 minutes before slicing.

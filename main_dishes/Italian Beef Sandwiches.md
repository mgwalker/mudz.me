title: Italian Beef Sandwiches
---

## Ingredients

* 1 4-pound roast of top sirloin or top round, trimmed of fat
* 2 Tablespoons kosher salt, divided
* 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided
* 2 Tablespoons grapeseed oil
* 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 onion, quartered
* 1 quart reduced-sodium beef stock
* 1 Tablespoon beef bouillon, preferably Knorr
* 2 Tablespoons dried oregano
* 2 Tablespoons garlic powder
* 2 Tablespoons onion powder
* 1 Tablespoon dried basil
* 1 teaspoon red chili flakes
* 1 Tablespoon celery seeds, optional
* 1 Tablespoon paprika, optional
* 8 sandwich rolls
* 1 quart giardiniera

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pat the beef dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix together 1 Tablespoon of the salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Sprinkle the mixture all over the roast and use your hands to rub the seasoning into the meat on all sides.

In a large, heavy-bottom, oven-proof pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the roast and brown well on all sides, using tongs to turn it as needed, 7 to 10 minutes total. Remove the meat from the pan and rest it on a plate. Leave any rendered fat in the pan.

Add the garlic and onion to the pan and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until very fragrant and just barely beginning to brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute, being careful not to let it burn. Immediately pour in the beef stock, and with a wooden spoon scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any stuck-on bits of beef. Stir in the bouillon, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, crushed chili flakes, optional celery seeds, paprika and the remaining 1 Tablespoon of salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper.

Return the beef to the pan and turn it a few times in the broth to moisten it all over. Slide the pan into the oven and cook, covered with aluminum foil, until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 125 to 150 degrees, about 1 hour. Remove from oven, let cool and then chill the beef in the braising liquid — pan and all — in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.

Remove from the refrigerator and, if desired, skim the layer of fat from the top and discard. While still cold, transfer the roast to a cutting board and use a large, sharp knife to slice the entire roast as thinly as possible — 1/8-inch thick or less (the thinner, the better). Meanwhile, return the pan with the jus to the stovetop over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Place the sliced meat in the pan with the jus and cook gently until the beef is warmed through and no longer pink, 10 to 12 minutes.

In the meantime, heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment. Slice the rolls lengthwise, partway but not all of the way through the equator, leaving the top and bottom attached to each other with a 1- to 2-inch “hinge.” Lay the rolls on the parchment, open side down. Toast them in the oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

To assemble the sandwiches, hold a roll in the palm of one hand with the opening facing up and the hinge resting in your palm. Holding the roll over the pan of meat, use tongs to lift a few slices of beef out of the jus and nestle them into the roll. Allow for plenty of jus to moisten the bread, spooning more of the liquid over the meat if the bread is too dry. Fill each roll with as much of the beef as you can fit — and then add a little more. Garnish with giardiniera to taste.

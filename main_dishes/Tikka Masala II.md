## Ingredients

### Marinade

* 1 1/4 cups whole milk yogurt
* 1 Tablespoon finely grated ginger 
* 4 teaspoons kosher salt 
* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder
* 1 teaspoon garam masala  
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 cloves garlic, finely grated 
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cubed

### Sauce

* 4 Tablespoons ghee
* 1 large onion, sliced 
* 2 serrano chiles, stemmed, seeded and chopped 
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
* 1 Tablespoon finely grated ginger 
* 4 cloves garlic, finely grated 
* 2 teaspoons dried whole fenugreek leaves
* 2 teaspoons garam masala 
* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder 
* 1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika 
* 1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 
* 1/4 cup heavy cream  
* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro

## Directions

For the marinade, whisk together the yogurt, ginger, salt, chili powder, garam masala, pepper, turmeric, and garlic in a large bowl until combined. Toss the chicken in the spiced yogurt marinade until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours.

For the sauce, melt the ghee in a large Dutch oven or wide heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions and serrano, season with the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant and the ginger starts to turn golden and sticks to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the fenugreek leaves, garam masala, chili powder, and paprika and cook, stirring occasionally, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced by half, about 30 minutes.

Let the sauce cool for about 5 minutes or so, then transfer it to a blender. Add the cream and blend to smooth puree. Return the sauce to the pot, season to taste with salt, and bring to a simmer.

Meanwhile, position a rack directly under the broiler and heat to high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and brush with oil. Spread the chicken in a single layer on the baking sheet. Broil for 8 minutes, then carefully pour off any liquid from the pan. Return to the oven and broil until cooked through and browning in spots, another 8 minutes.

Add the chicken and the cilantro to the simmering sauce, and stir to combine. Serve with rice or naan.

title: Corn and Coconut Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 5 ears yellow, or 5 cups frozen corn kernels
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and minced
* 1 serrano chile, minced
* 2 small red potatoes, cubed
* 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
* 1 15-ounce can full-fat coconut milk
* 1 Tablespoon lime juice
* Kosher salt, to taste

## Directions

Cut the corn kernels off the cobs and transfer to a bowl. Using the back of a butter knife, scrape the cobs so that all of the milky juices collect in the bowl and the cobs look completely dry. Set aside.

In a large stockpot over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the shallots, garlic, ginger, and serrano, and sauté, stirring occasionally, until soft and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add corn kernels and juices to the pot, and sauté until the corn is softer and brighter, about 3 minutes more. Add the potato and stir to coat, 1 to 2 minutes.

Pour in the vegetable broth and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender all the way through.

Ladle about half of the soup into a blender, blend until smooth, and return to the pot. Season with lime juice and salt, and mix to combine.

title: Dijon Potatoes with Chicken
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound chicken, sliced
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 4 medium potatoes, cubed
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 Tablespoon butter
* Salt and pepper, to taste

### Sauce
* 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 Tablespoon cider vinegar
* 1 Tablespoon water
* 1 Tablespoon whole-grain mustard
* 4 teaspoons tarragon, minced

## Directions

Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Generously
season the chicken with salt and pepper, and saut√© until browned and
cooked through. Remove to a plate.

Add the remaining oil to the same pan. Once hot, add the potatoes and
season generously with salt and pepper. Press the potatoes into a single
layer, add the water, and cover. Leave for 5 minutes. Add the butter,
cover and allow to cook another 15 minutes, stirring once halfway
through, until the potatoes are tender.

While the potatoes are cooking, make the sauce. Add the Dijon, honey, vinegar, water, whole-grain mustard and tarragon to a small bowl and whisk until well combined.

Once the potatoes are done, add the sauce and chicken to the
pan. Toss to combine, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until heated
through. Serve.

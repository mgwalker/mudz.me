## Ingredients

* 1 cup wild rice, rinsed
* 4 cups water
* pinch of salt
* 1 cup cream
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/2 cup chopped roasted hazelnuts
* 1/4 cup dried blueberries
* 1/4 cup dried cranberries

## Directions

Place the rice, water, and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the rice is tender and chewy, 45 - 60 minutes. Drain, and return the rice to the saucepan. Stir in the cream and maple syrup, then bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until the cream thickens slightly and the surface of the rice is coated in bubbles, about 6 minutes. Stir in the hazelnuts, blueberries, and cranberries. Serve warm.

title: The Bearâ€™s Family Meal Spaghetti
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup olive oil
* 10 crushed cloves of garlic
* 1 Tablespoon red pepper flakes
* A handful fresh basil, including stems
* 2 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes
* 1 large yellow onion, sliced in half
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed
* 1 Tablespoon canola oil
* 16 ounces pasta, such as spaghetti

## Directions

Add the olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and basil to a small pan on medium low. Bring to a boil and cook until the basil wilted, 3 - 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside.

Add the canola oil and butter to a large pot over medium heat. Once the butter finishes foaming, add the onion halves cut side down and sear, 3 - 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Season generously with salt, then cover and simmer for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, strain the oil and discard the solids. (Skip this step for a chunkier texture.) After the tomatoes have simmered, add the oil to the sauce and simmer another 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to package directions, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.

Remove the onion halves from the sauce and discard. Add the pasta and reserved water into the sauce, toss to coat, and let it continue to cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, 1 minute. Serve with more basil and shredded parmesan.

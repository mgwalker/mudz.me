## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons butter, divided
* 3 pounds chicken pieces
* 1/2 cup onion, chopped
* 2 cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 1/2 teaspoons vadouvan
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cup chicken stock

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F.

Melt 1 Tablespoon of butter over medium high heat in an oven safe skillet or Dutch oven. Sear the chicken in batches and remove to a plate.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 Tablespoons of butter to the pan. When melted, add the onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and vadouvan. Sauté until the onion is translucent and soft. Add the chicken back to the pan, along with the chicken stock and bay leaf.

Cover the pan and transfer it to the oven. Bake until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 40 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with rice.

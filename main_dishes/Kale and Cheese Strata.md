title: Kale and Cheese Strata
---

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon olive oil
* 1 large onion, minced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 3 cups kale, chopped
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes
* 1 teaspoon butter
* 8 cups french bread, cubed
* 2 cups grated gruyere
* 2 cups grated aged white cheddar
* 1 cup grated parmesan
* 8 large eggs
* 2 cups milk
* 3 Tablespoons dijon mustard

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium high heat. Add the onion
and cook, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes, or until the onion is
soft. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the kale and let
it cook until it has wilted. Add the salt, pepper and chili flakes, stir
to combine, then remove the pan from the heat.

Butter the bottom of a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish. Add 1/3 of
the bread cubes then top with 1/3 of the kale and 1/3 of
each of the cheeses. Repeat 3 times, reserving a small handful of
cheeses.

Whisk together the eggs, milk and dijon mustard in a medium sized bowl.
Slowly and carefully pour the mixture over the bread. The pan will be
very full so you will need to go slow enough to give the eggs and milk
time to soak into the bread. Top the strata with the remaining handful
of cheese then cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake the for 45-55
minutes, or until it is puffed, browned and set in the centre.

Let it stand for 10 minutes before serving.

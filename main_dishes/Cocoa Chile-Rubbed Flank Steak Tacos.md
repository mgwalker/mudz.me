title: Cocoa Chile-Rubbed Flank Steak Tacos
---

## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/2 Tablespoon ancho chile powder
* 1/2 Tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 1/2 pounds flank steak
* 1 Tablespoon avocado oil

## Directions

Stir together the cocoa powder, ancho chile powder, salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, garlic, cumin, and cinnamon. Generously rub onto both sides of the flank steak, and let the steak rest uncovered at room temperature for 1 hour.

Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. After a couple of minutes, when the oil begins to shimmer, add the steak. Cook for 8 minutes, turning once, for medium-rare. When the steak is done, remove it from the skillet and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.

Serve with warm tortillas, guacamole, and pico de gallo.

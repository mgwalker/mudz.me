## Ingredients

* 1 cup cooked chickpeas
* 3 Tablespoons butter
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 2 large shallots, sliced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 jalapeño or serrano chile, diced
* 2 teaspoons fresh ginger, minced
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon chile powder
* 1 teaspoon fenugreek leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 medium tomatoes, diced
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup coconut milk
* 1 Tablespoon honey

## Directions

Heat a large pot over medium heat and melt the butter. Add the bay leaves, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds, and fry until fragrant, 1 - 2 minutes. Add the shallots and sauté until golden, 5 - 7 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, and chile, and sauté 2 - 3 minutes.

Stir in the garam masala, cumin, coriander, chile powder, fenugreek leaves, and turmeric, then add the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes begin to break down, about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add the water, coconut milk, salt, chickpeas, and honey, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer gently 10 - 15 minutes. Serve warm.

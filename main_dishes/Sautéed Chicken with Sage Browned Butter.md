title: SauteÃÅed Chicken with Sage Browned Butter
---

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds chicken breast filets
* 1/2 cup flour
* 3 Tablespoons butter
* 2 sage sprigs
* 1 Tablespoon shallot, minced
* 1 teaspoon thyme
* 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
* Olive oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Pound the the chicken into 1/4-inch thick cutlets. Season generously with salt and pepper.

Add enough olive oil to barely coat the bottom of a large skillet, and heat on medium-high. Once the pan is hot, dredge the chicken in the flour and, working in batches, fry until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate.

Once all the chicken is cooked, add the butter and sage to the pan and cook until the butter browns. Discard the sage, and add the shallots and thyme. Cook until the shallots turn soft, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Spoon over the chicken and serve.

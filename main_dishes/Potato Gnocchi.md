## Ingredients

* 3 pounds large baking potatoes
* 2 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 Tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Olive oil
* Butter

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F.

Wash the potatoes, prick them with a fork and place them on a sheet pan.
Bake them until very soft, about 1 1/2 to 2
hours.

While the potatoes are baking, beat the eggs and yolk lightly together
in a small bowl. In a large bowl, combine flour, rosemary, salt, a few
grinds of freshly ground black pepper.

When the potatoes are soft, cool them slightly and scoop out the
insides. Rice the scooped potato with a ricer, or mash them with a fork.
Add the potatoes and eggs to the flour and mix gently with your hands
until all the ingredients are well incorporated and the dough is
smooth.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured flat surface. Lightly knead
and add a little more flour if the dough is overly sticky. Let the dough
rest for 10 minutes, uncovered. In a large pot, bring a gallon of water
and a 1 Tablespoon of salt to a boil.

Roll the dough into thin 1/2-inch thick logs and cut into 1/2-inch
pieces. Using a generous amount of flour, press each piece against your
thumb tip to make a dent or roll it over the back and off the tip of a
floured fork tines to make the traditional ridged shape. Place the
finished gnocchi on a lightly floured sheet pan. Cook them as soon as
possible in boiling salted water.

Add equal parts butter and olive oil to a large skillet over medium
heat. Add the gnocchi to the boiling water. When they rise to the top,
let them cook for a minute or two and then remove them with a slotted
spoon. Add them directly to the skillet, and sauté until lightly browned
on all sides. Season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken thighs, cubed
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1 large onion, diced
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 Tablespoons grated ginger
* 1/2 cup mint
* 2 Tablespoons garam masala
* 1 Tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 3 whole star anise
* 3 dry bay leaves
* 1 cup full-fat unsweetened coconut milk
* 1 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste

## Directions

In a blender or food processor, puree the onion, garlic, ginger, and mint.

Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, then add the chicken and saut√© until browned but not cooked through, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

Add the pureed mint mixture to the pan and stir to combine with the juices in the pan. Cook until very aromatic, 3 - 4 minutes. Add the garam masala, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, anise, and bay leaves, and stir to combine. Stir in the coconut milk and vegetable stock, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to low. Return the chicken to the pan, cover, and simmer 30 - 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Serve hot with naan or rice.

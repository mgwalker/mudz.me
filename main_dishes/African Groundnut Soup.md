## Ingredients

* 1 Tablespoon chermoula
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 3/4 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons peanut oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 clove garlic, smashed and chopped
* 1 Tablespoon minced ginger
* 1 14-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
* 4 cups vegetable stock
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1/2 cup unsalted peanut butter
* 1/2 pound adzuki beans, cooked
* 1 poblano
* 1 red bell pepper
* 3 plum tomatoes, halved
* 1 Tablespoon parsley, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon mint, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts
* zest of 1 lime

## Directions

Heat large pot on high heat. Pour in peanut oil, and then add onions.
Sauté for 4-5 minutes, then add garlic and ginger. Reduce heat to medium
and continue to cook until soft and translucent, another 10 minutes. Add
the spices and stir until mixed well. Pour in crushed fire-roasted
tomatoes, stock and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then simmer for at
least 1 hour. Strain broth, then puree solids with 1-2 cups of broth
until very smooth. Return all the broth and pureed vegetables to the pot
and stir to combine.

While the broth is simmering, place the poblano, red bell pepper, and
tomatoes (cut-side up) on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil until the
skin on the peppers is puffed up and blackened, and the tomatoes are
slightly charred. Remove from the oven, rub the skin from the peppers,
and dice all the vegetables.

Turn the oven to 425° F. Toss the sweet potatoes with a bit of peanut
oil, salt, and pepper, and roast until tender, about 45 minutes.

Place the peanut butter into medium bowl and slowly whisk in 1 cup of
broth until the mixture is smooth. Pour the mixture back into pot with
broth. Add in the cooked beans, sweet potatoes, peppers, tomatoes,
peanuts, parsley, and mint. Season with salt and lime zest to taste.

## Ingredients

* 3 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 jalapeño, chopped
* 1/2 large onion, chopped
* 2 Tablespoons cilantro
* 2 Tablespoons lime Juice
* 14 1/2 ounces crushed tomatoes
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon thyme
* 1 Tablespoon butter
* 1 Tablespoon olive oil
* 2 chicken breasts, cubed
* 1/2 cup dry sherry
* 1 cup acini di pepe
* Kosher salt
* Black pepper

## Directions

Place the garlic, jalapeño, onion, cilantro, lime juice, tomatoes, cumin, oregano, and thyme in a blender. Blend until smooth.

In a pan, melt the butter and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the chicken and season generously with salt and pepper. Leave for 30 seconds - 1 minute without stirring to get a good sear. Sautee until the chicken is cooked through, then remove to a plate. Deglaze the pan with the sherry, then reduce until dry. Add the acini di pepe and toast until golden.

Pour the blended sauce over the pasta, add the chicken and any juices it might have released, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.

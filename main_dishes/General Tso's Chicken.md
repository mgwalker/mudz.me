## Ingredients

* 10 oz boneless skinless chicken meat (thigh or breast), cut into
* bite-sized pieces
* 1/2 Tablespoon Shaoxing wine
* Pinch of salt
* 1/3 cup cornstarch
* Oil for deep frying
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons oil
* 3 slices peeled ginger, finely minced
* 1 clove garlic, finely minced
* 4-5 dried red chiles, rinsed and deseeded
* 2 stalks scallion, white-part only, cut into 1-inch lengths

### Sauce

* 2 1/2 -- 3 Tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar
* 2 1/2 Tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1/2 Tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon Hoisin sauce
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 1/2 Tablespoons sugar
* 1/2 Tablespoon Shaoxing Wine
* 1 scant Tablespoon corn starch

## Directions

Marinate the chicken meat with the Shaoxing wine and salt for 15
minutes. Mix all the ingredients for the Sauce in a small bowl. Set
aside.

Coat the chicken generously with the 1/3 cup cornstarch. Heat up the oil
for deep-frying. Deep fry the chicken until they turn light brown. Dish
out with a strainer, and drain on paper towels.

Heat up a wok with 1 1/2 Tablespoons oil. Add the minced ginger, garlic,
and dried chilies into the wok, stir-fry until you smell the spicy aroma
of the chilies. Pour the sauce into the wok. When the sauce boils and
thickens, add the chicken, stir to combine well with the sauce. Add the
scallion and stir a few times, dish out and serve immediately.

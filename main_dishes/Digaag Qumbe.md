## Ingredients

* 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
* 1 jalapeño, chopped
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
* 1 Tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/2 cup plain whole milk yogurt
* 2 Tablespoons xawaash
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 large red onion, minced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon grated ginger
* 1 large potato, cubed
* 2 carrots, thinly sliced
* 1 pound chicken thighs, cubed
* 1 cup full-fat unsweetened coconut milk
* 2 Tablespoons cilantro, minced

## Directions

In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes, jalapeño, bell pepper, tomato paste, yogurt, xawaash, and salt, and puree until smooth.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, and cook until just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the blended tomato mixture, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the potato, carrots, chicken, and coconut milk. Cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt, and serve with rice and bananas.

## Ingredients

* 6 strips bacon, diced
* 1 cup ham, diced
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 4 stalks celery, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* 2 potatoes, diced
* 3 cups frozen corn
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 3 Tablespoons butter
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, finely grated
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until crisp. Using a
slotted spoon, remove to paper towels to drain. In the same pan, cook
the ham until lightly browned. Remove and drain. In the drippings, saut√©
the onion, celery, and garlic until soft. Add the potatoes, corn,
chicken stock, and paprika, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer
until the potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the
flour and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk and cream.
Turn off the heat, add the cheese, and cover. Allow to stand for 5
minutes, then stir through. Gradually add to the pot with the vegetables
and stir until well combined. Simmer until thick. Add the bacon and ham,
season with salt and pepper, and serve.

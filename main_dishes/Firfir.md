## Ingredients

* 2 large tomatoes
* 3 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1 large onion, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon grated ginger
* 1 Tablespoon rosemary, minced
* 1 Tablespoon berbere
* 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 cup water
* 2 kicha or 1 large injera, torn into small pieces

## Directions

Cut the tomatoes in half, then coarsely grate them on a box grater. Discard the skins.

Warm the oil in a heavy pot set over medium heat. Stir in the onion and salt, and cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, rosemary, berbere, and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. Add the grated tomatoes and cook until they have nearly evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the water, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Add in the kicha and stir gently until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Season with salt, to taste.

## Ingredients


### Dough

* 4 1/2 teaspoons yeast
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1 cup warm milk
* 1/4 cup butter, softened
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 4 cups flour

### Filling

* 1 1/2 - 2 pounds lean ground beef
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 small green cabbage, chopped into bite sized pieces
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 2 4-ounce jars pimentos
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

## Directions

Dissolve the yeast in the water. Set in a warm place. Add thewarm milk, butter, and salt. Let stand for 10 minutes. Add the flour and sugar, and stir through to form a shaggy dough. Cover and put in a warm place for an hour or until doubled in size. Punch down the dough and form it into 12 balls of roughly equal size. Place in a baking dish, cover, and leave to rise again, another hour.

Heat the oven to 350Â° F.

Season the ground beef with salt and pepper. Brown with the onion, red pepper, and garlic. Drain. Add the cabbage and pimientos, and cook until the cabbage is tender. Turn off the heat, add the cheese, and cover for approximately 1 minute, or until the cheese is mostly melted, and stir until mixed through.

Once the dough is ready, roll out each portion into a 6-inch circle. Place approximately 3/4 cup of filling in the center of each, pinch to close, and bake on a cookie sheet for 25 - 35 minutes, or until browned. Rub with butter while still warm.

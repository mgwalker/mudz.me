## Ingredients


### Dough

* 2 packages (or 4 1/2 teaspoons) yeast
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1 cup warm milk
* 1/4 cup soft butter
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 4 cups flour

### Filling

* 1 1/2 - 2 pounds lean ground beef
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 green pepper, chopped
* 1 small green cabbage, chopped into bite sized pieces
* salt
* pepper
* garlic powder
* 2 4-ounce jars pimentos
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

## Directions

Dissolve yeast in water. Set in a warm place. Add warm milk, butter and
salt. Let stand for 10 minutes. Add flour and sugar, and stir through.
Cover and put in warm place for an hour or until doubled in size. Punch
down the dough and form it into 12 balls of roughly equal size. Place in
a baking dish, cover, and leave to rise again, another hour.

Heat the oven to 350Â°F.

Season ground beef with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Brown with onion
and green pepper. Drain. Add cabbage and pimientos and cook until
cabbage is tender. Turn off heat, add cheese and cover for approximately
1 minute, or until cheese is mostly melted, and stir until mixed
through.

Once dough is ready, roll out on a floured surface into 6-inch circles.
Place approximately 3/4 cup filling in center of each, pinch to close
and bake on cookie sheet 25 -- 35 minutes, or until browned. Rub with
butter while still warm.

## Ingredients

### Pancake
* 4 large eggs
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 Tablespoons brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter

### Caramelized Apples
* 2 Tablespoons unsalted butter 
* 1/2 cup sugar 
* 4 medium Granny Smith apples, diced

## Directions

Heat the oven to 425Â° F.

In a blender add the eggs, milk, oats, flour, brown sugar, and salt and mix until a smooth batter is formed.

In a large ovenproof skillet, melt the butter. Turn off the heat, pour in the batter, and bake until lightly browned and puffy, 20 - 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle the sugar over the top, then add the apples. Once the sugar begins to melt, adjust the heat so the juices bubble rapidly. Cook, stirring, until the apples are tender and juices are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Remove from the oven, add the caramelized apples, fold the pancake in half, slice, and serve.

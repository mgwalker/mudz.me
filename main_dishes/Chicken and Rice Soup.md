## Ingredients

### Stock

* 2 carrots, chopped
* 2 stalks celery, chopped
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 piece ginger, chopped
* 2 stalks lemongrass, bruised
* 1 sprig basil
* 1 sprig tarragon
* 1 sprig thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
* 1 whole chicken, 3 - 4 pounds

### Soup

* 1 carrot, chopped
* 1 stalk celery, chopped
* 4 ounces maitake mushrooms, chopped
* 1/2 large onion, minced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup Shaoxing rice wine, or dry sherry
* 1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
* Reserved stock
* Reserved chicken
* Kosher salt

## Directions

To make the stock, place all the ingredients in a large stock pot and add enough water to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 2 hours. Remove the chicken, and allow the chicken to cool. Meanwhile, strain the stock through a sieve into a large bowl set over ice. Cover and refrigerate. Once the chicken is cool, separate the meat from the bones and cube. Refrigerate.

To make the soup, melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the butter until it stops foaming, and the solids at the bottom begin to brown. Add the carrot, celery, mushrooms, and onions, season generously with salt, and sautee until the mushrooms and onions turn soft. Add the garlic and sautee for another 1 minute. Add 4 cups of reserved stock as well as the rice wine, bring a boil, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 10 minutes before stirring in the rice. Simmer until the rice is cooked, about 20 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of reserved chicken, and continue cooking until the chicken is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt.

### Tomato Sauce

* 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil

* 1 15-ounce can tomato sauce
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 Tablespoon white vinegar
* Salt, to taste
* Water, as needed

### Yogurt Sauce

* 1/2 cup plain whole milk yogurt

## Directions

To make the filling, add all the ingredients to a large bowl and knead to combine. Set aside.

To make the dough, combine the flour, oil, and salt in a medium bowl. Slowly add in the water, mixing with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 7 - 8 minutes.

To make the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, garlic powder, and black pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the vinegar, stir to combine, and simmer another 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.

To make the yogurt sauce, add all the ingredients to a non-metal bowl and stir to combine. Refrigerate.

To make the dumplings, rub a small amount of vegetable oil on the counter, then divide the dough into four equal portions. Roll out one portion into a very thin rectangle, until the counter below is barely visible. Use a bench scraper or knife to divide the rectangle into four wrappers. Use a spoon or your hands to scoop out a large portion of filling and place it in the center of one the rolled-out wrappers. Fold up the opposing corners of the wrapper and pinch together firmly to seal. Repeat for the remaining dough.

Heat 2 Tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half of the dumplings to the pan and fry until golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Very carefully pour in about 1/2 cup of water and immediately cover the skillet with a lid. Steam until the dumplings are cooked through, 12 - 15 minutes. A meat thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165° F. Remove the dumplings to a baking dish. Repeat for the remaining dumplings. Reheat the tomato sauce over medium heat, then pour over the dumplings. Spoon the yogurt sauce over the top and serve.

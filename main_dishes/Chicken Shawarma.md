## Ingredients

### Chicken

* 2 Tablespoons corn starch
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon coriander
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon cloves 
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
* 2 Tablespoons oil
* 2 pounds chicken thighs

### Yogurt

* 1 1/4 cups whole milk Yogurt
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup oil
* 1 Tablespoon mustard seeds
* 1 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Grease a loaf pan.

In a small bowl, combine the corn starch, salt, cayenne, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, and cloves, and stir to combine. In a large bowl, add the oil and chicken, and stir to coat. Add the spice mix, stir to coat, layer the chicken in the loaf pan, and press down firmly. Bake for 40 minutes.

While the chicken is cooking, add the yogurt and garlic to a heatproof bowl. Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds. When they begin to pop, stir in the mustard powder, and immediately pour over the yogurt. Add the cilantro and stir to combine. Refrigerate.

Remove the chicken from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken out onto a cutting board and shave with a knife.

To serve, top a flatbread with the chicken, yogurt, pickled onions, and fresh herbs.

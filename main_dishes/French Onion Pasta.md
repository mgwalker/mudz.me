## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 3 yellow onions, thinly sliced
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 1 Tablespoon fresh thyme
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 cups beef stock
* 12 ounces dried orecchiette, or other short cut pasta
* 1 Tablespoon white wine vinegar
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
* 1/2 cup hredded Gruyére cheese

## Directions

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.

Heat the oil over a large skillet over medium heat. When shimmering, add the onions and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently until the onions are deeply caramelized, 30 - 45 minutes. 

To the pan with the onions, add the garlic, mushrooms, and thyme. Sauté for 3 - 4 minutes or until the mushrooms begin to soften. Add the wine to deglaze the pan and add the flour. Cook for another 2 - 3 minutes, until thickened. Pour in the beef stock, bring to a boil, and simmer until reduced to a sauce consistency.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to package directions in the pot of boiling water. Drain, then add to the pan with the onions along with the white wine vinegar. Stir to combine,

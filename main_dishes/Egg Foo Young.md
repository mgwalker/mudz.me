## Ingredients

* 3 large eggs, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
* 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine or cooking sherry, optional
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
* Pinch of sugar
* 3 dashes white pepper
* 3 Tablespoons oil
* 2 oz bean sprouts
* 2 oz ground pork
* 4 medium-sized shrimp, peeled and chopped
* 1 scallion, cut into small rings

## Directions

Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork. Add the rest of the
ingredients into the beaten eggs, and stir to combine well. Make sure
the oyster sauce is fully dissolved.

Heat up a wok or a pan on high heat. Add the oil. When the oil is fully
heated, ladle the egg mixture into the pan. Make sure that you keep the
diameter of the omelet to about 4-5 inches wide. Gently push the bean
sprouts and other ingredients to the middle of the omelet. The omelet
should be thicker in the center. Fry the omelet until well browned and
crispy at the edges, about 3 minutes, before flipping it over. Repeat
the same and use the remaining egg mixture to make a total of 3 omelets.
Serve immediately.

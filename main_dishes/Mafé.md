## Ingredients

* 1⁄2 cup peanut butter
* 2 cups beef stock
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 4 garlic cloves minced
* 2 pounds beef stew meat, trimmed and cut into 1 and 1⁄2 inch cubes
* 2 cups tomatoes, diced
* 1 sprig thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cup red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 jalapeño, chopped
* 1 cup carrots, chopped
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Whisk together the peanut butter and stock in a bowl and set aside.
Season the meat with salt and pepper.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Brown the meat well
on all sides. Remove the meat to a plate and keep
warm.

To the same pan, add the onion, garlic, peppers, and carrots, and sauté
until the onions are translucent. Add the peanut butter and stock
mixture. Return the reserved meat and any juices to the saucepan. Add
the tomatoes and their liquid, the thyme, and the bay leaf. Stir well
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often,
for about 1 hour or until the meat is tender.

Remove the thyme sprig and the bay leaf and discard. Serve hot over
rice.

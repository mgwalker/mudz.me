## Ingredients


### Filling

* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3 medium carrots, halved lengthwise, sliced 1/2 inch thick
* 2 celery stalks, sliced 1/2 inch thick
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cubed
* 4 1/2 cups chicken stock
* 1/4 cup celery leaves, chopped
* 1 cup frozen peas
* Salt and black pepper, to taste

### Dumplings

* 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)
* 1 Tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* 1 cup buttermilk milk


## Directions

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the carrots, celery, and onion, and season with salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add the wine and simmer until completely evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the butter until completely melted. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir until it is completely incorporated and a sandy paste forms. Pour in the milk and stir until the flour has been smoothly incorporated into the liquid. Add the chicken and the chicken stock to the pot and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the celery leaves and peas, and remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

To make the dumplings, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in the melted butter until just combined, then add the buttermilk and stir until a ball of dough forms. Use a spoon to scoop out balls of dough and gently place them on top of the filling in the pot. Cover the pot and simmer over medium-low until the dumplings have puffed up and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot.

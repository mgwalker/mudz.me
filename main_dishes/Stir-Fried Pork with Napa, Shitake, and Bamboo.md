title: Stir-Fried Pork with Napa, Shitake, and Bamboo
---

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces noodles
* 8 ounces pork shoulder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon sugar
* 3 Tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1 head Napa cabbage, shredded
* 4 dried shittake mushrooms
* 1/2 cup bamboo shoots, cut into 1/4 inch julienne
* 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* Ground white pepper

## Directions

In a medium bowl soak the mushrooms in cold water until soften about 30
minutes. Thinly slice the mushrooms and set aside.

Boil the noodles according to package directions. Rinse quickly with
cold water, toss with some oil, and set aside.

Cut pork into thin matchstick slivers, about 1/4 thick. Mix together the
cornstarch, soy sauce, rice wine, salt, and sugar. Add the pork and stir
to coat. Set aside.

Heat wok over high heat. Swirl in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and add
the pork. Cook undisturbed for 15 seconds, letting the pork brown
slightly. Then stir-fry for 1 minute longer until pork is tender. Set
aside.

Pour in remaining vegetable oil and add garlic, cabbage, bamboo shoots,
and shittake. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes until vegetables are cooked
through. Add the noodles and pork into the wok and stir-fry to mix,
adding salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

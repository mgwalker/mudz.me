title: Tuscan Sausage and Potato Soup
---

## Ingredients

* 1 pound hot Italian sausage
* 1/2 pound pancetta, chopped
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed
* 2 large russet potatoes, cubed
* 6 cups chicken stock
* 2 cups kale, chopped
* 1/4 cup Italian parsley, chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

In a dutch oven over medium high heat, brown the sausage. Drain and set aside. Brown the pancetta and remove from the pan, reserving 2 Tablespoons of fat.

Sauté the onion and garlic in the fat over medium heat and season generously with salt, until the onion turns translucent. Add the fennel seed and potatoes, season again with salt, and sauté about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, sausage, and bacon to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Simmer uncovered until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes, parsley, and kale, and simmer until the kale wilts, about 5 minutes. Season to taste.

## Ingredients


### Pie Crust

* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 5 Tablespoons butter, cut into cubes
* 3 Tablespoons lard

### Filling

* 2-3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 onion, diced
* 1/4 pound carrots, diced
* 2 celery ribs, diced
* 3 - 4 cups chicken stock
* 1 pound cooked chicken thighs, cubed
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 ounces flour
* 1/2 cup shredded cheddar
* 1/2 Tablespoon poultry seasoning
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed rosemary
* 1/2 teaspoon thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon summery savory
* 6 ounces frozen baby peas

## Directions

Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Use your fingers to rub the butter and lard into the flour until it takes on the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. Add the water a little at a time and mix with your hand. Remove the hydrated dough to a floured surface and add a little more water to the dry crumbs still in the bowl, mix together, and add to the rest of the dough. Use the heel of your hand to smear the dough a little at time until you've gone through the whole dough twice. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

In a large stockpot, sauté the onions in the olive oil until
translucent. Add in the celery and carrots, and cook until fragrant. Add
2 cups of chicken stock, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer
until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Strain, reserving the vegetables and the stock. 

In another saucepan, melt the butter, then whisk in the
flour. Cook until slightly darkened, about 2 minutes, then whisk in the strained stock. Whisk in more stock as necessary, until it takes on the texture of gravy. Turn off the heat and whisk in the cheddar. Season with salt and pepper, as
desired. Add the gravy to the vegetables, then add the peas, chicken,
and seasonings. Stir to combine.

Divide the dough into 1/3 and 2/3 portions. Roll out the larger portion to an oval about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully transfer to the bottom of an oval baking dish, draping the excess over the edges. Trim off pieces of the excess to patch the sides as necessary, then pour in the filling. Roll out the smaller portion, drape it over the pie, and fold and press the edges together. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape.

Bake at 400° F until the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes.

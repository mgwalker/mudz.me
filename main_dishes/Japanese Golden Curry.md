## Ingredients

### Stew
* 1 pound chicken thighs, trimmed and cubed
* 1 Tablespoon oil
* 3 onions, sliced
* 1 Tablespoon butter
* 2 carrots, cubed
* 2 potatoes, cubed
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, grated
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1 apple
* 1 Tablespoon garam masala
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Optional: crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, star anise, butter, chocolate, coffee powder, honey, ketchup, oyster sauce, sake, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, yogurt, green peas

### Curry Roux
* 3 Tablespoons butter
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 Tablespoons curry powder
* Optional: cayenne

## Directions

Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.

Heat a Tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the chicken and saut√©e until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

Heat a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the butter and heat until the foaming subsides. Add the onions and a pinch of salt, and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook the onions, stirring frequently, until caramelized, 30 - 45 minutes.

Add the ginger and garlic, and cook until fragrant. Add the cooked chicken and the chicken stock. Peel the apple and grate it into the pot. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Meanwhile, heat a clean skillet over low heat and add the garam masala. When it's fragrant, add it to the pot.

After 30 minutes, add the carrots and potaotes. Simmer another 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

Meanwhile, make the curry roux. Heat a small skillet over medium-low heat and add the butter. Once the foaming subsides, whisk in the flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux turns light brown. Removes from the heat and whisk in the curry powder. Set aside.

When the potatoes are tender, add the curry roux and stir until it has completely melted and the curry has turned thick. Serve over rice.

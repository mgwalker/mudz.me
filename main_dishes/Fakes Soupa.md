## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound lentils, soaked
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 red onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 celery rib, diced
* 1 Tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 cups vegetable stock
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* Black pepper, to taste
* 1 Tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 2 Tablespoons parsley, minced

## Directions

In a large pot heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft, 2 - 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the carrot and celery and sauté another 3 - 5 minutes.

Stir in the tomato paste, then add the vegetable stock, lentils, bay, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer, covered, until the lentils are tender but not mushy. (Brown lentils will cook in about 30 minutes, green lentils will take about 45 minutes.) Turn off the heat, stir in the red wine vinegar and parsley, and season to taste with salt and black pepper.

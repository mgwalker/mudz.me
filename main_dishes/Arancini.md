## Ingredients

* 3 cups unsalted chicken stock
* Kosher salt
* 1 cup arborio rice
* 2 Tablespoons pine nuts, toasted
* 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (2 ounces)
* 1/2 cup shredded fontina cheese (2 ounces)
* 2 Tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs, divided

## Directions

Bring the stock and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan
over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice, reduce the heat to low and
simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.

Combine the pine nuts, mozzarella, fontina and parsley in a bowl; set
aside.

Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then stir in the cooled rice, the
parmesan and 2/3 cup breadcrumbs. Shape the mixture into sixteen 1
1/2-inch balls. Press your finger into the center of each rice ball,
insert 2 teaspoons of the mozzarella mixture, then pinch the rice around
the filling to enclose. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment
paper. Loosely cover and refrigerate, at least 1 hour or overnight.

Heat the oven to 375Â° F. Roll the rice balls in the remaining bread
crumbs, and place back on the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown,
30-45 minutes.

NOTE: Shaping takes the longest. So, so long.

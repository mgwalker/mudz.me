title: Black Bean Dal
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 pound dry black beans
* 2 ounces dry kidney beans
* 3 cups water
* 1 Tablespoon oil
* 1 red chili, deseeded and chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 Tablespoon ginger, minced
* 1 Tablespoon coriander
* 1 Tablespoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 5 tomatoes
* 1/4 cup butter
* Water
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Rinse the beans to remove any dirt, then place them in a large bowl and cover
with an inch of water. Leave to soak overnight.

Pour the beans and the water into a medium saucepan, and add enough water to cover the beans by two inches. Bring to a boil and reduce
the heat to low. Simmer until the beans are tender, at least two hours. Drain, reserving the broth, and mash the beans with a large spoon.

Puree the tomatoes with the chili, garlic, and ginger. Heat the oil in a
large pot. Add the pureed tomatoes and the spices, and stir until combined. Cover
and cook over medium heat until thick, about 10 minutes. Add the beans
and mix thoroughly. Add the butter, stirring until the butter is melted. Add the bean broth a little at a time, to reach desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

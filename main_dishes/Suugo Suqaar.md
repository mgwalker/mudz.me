## Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small red bell pepper, diced
* 1 small red onion, diced
* 1 pound ground beef
* 3 Tablespoons xawaash
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup water
* 1 pound cooked pasta

## Directions

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, bell pepper, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Add the beef, xawaash, and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes.

Add the tomato paste to the pan and stir to combine. Add the crushed tomatoes, then pour the water into the can and swirl it around to collect all the leftover tomato juice before pouring it into the pot. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Season to taste with salt and serve over cooked pasta.

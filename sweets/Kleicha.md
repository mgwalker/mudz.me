## Ingredients

### Dough

* 5 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup melted butter
* 1 Tablespoon active dry yeast
* 1 Tablespoon caster sugar
* 1/2 Tablespoon salt
* 5 Tablespoons water
* 2 Tablespoons nigella seeds

### Filling

* 20 ounces date paste
* 3 Tablespoons sunflower oil
* 1 Tablespoon ground cardamom

### Egg Wash

* 1 egg yolk
* 2 Tablespoons milk

## Directions

### Dough

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the flour, yeast, nigella seeds and sugar. Dig a well in the center of the flour and add in the butter. With the mixer running on low speed, add the water gradually and mix for 2 minutes. Add the salt. Mix to obtain a soft, slightly moist and homogeneous dough. (If necessary, add a little water if the dough is too hard or, on the contrary, a little flour if it is too sticky.)

Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rise for one hour in a warm place away from drafts.

### Filling

While the dough is rising, prepare the date filling. In a large Dutch oven, heat the sunflower oil. Add the date paste and stir to combine. As the pot warms, the date paste should start to soften. Finally, add the ground cardamom. Continue stirring for 5 minutes until obtaining a smooth texture that can easily be spread.

### Assembly

Heat the oven 350Â° F. Divide the dough into 4 pieces.

On a large sheet of parchment paper, spread the first dough in a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. The parchment paper will help to roll the kleicha more easily.

Place the date paste between two large sheets of parchment paper and spread it about the same size as the dough. Remove the top parchment paper from the rolled date paste, then turn the date paste over and place it on the dough. Detach the other sheet. Alternatively, take small pieces of date paste, and flatten them on the dough, until the surface is all covered.

Starting from the largest part of the rectangle, tightly roll the dough over on itself. Press down gently to slightly flatten the roll.

Beat the milk and egg yolk in a bowl. Brush the entire surface with this mixture and cut 1/2-inch thick slices. Place the slices on a lined baking, standing up with the opening facing down. Repeat the process with the other three pieces of dough.

Bake for 20 minutes, then cool on wire racks.

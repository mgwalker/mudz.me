## Ingredients

* ⅔ Cup Butter
* ¼ Cup Dark Brown Sugar
* 5 Tablespoons Maple Syrup
* 2 Cups Oats
* ⅓ Cup Pecans (Chopped)
* ⅓ Cup Dried Cherries (Chopped)
* ⅛ Cup Salted Peanuts (Chopped)
* Melted Dark (70%+) Chocolate

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease and line a deep, square baking
tray. Add the oats, chopped nuts and fruit to a large bowl.

In a saucepan, melt the butter, sugar and maple syrup together. Simmer
it gently for about 2 minutes then pour the melted mixture over the oats
and mix well. Once combined, transfer the mixture to the prepared tray.
Smooth out the mixture until even, and pat it down until firm. Bake in
the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden on top.

Once cooked, allow to cool before removing from the pan and cutting into
bars. Garnish the energy bars with a drizzle of some good quality melted
chocolate. Consume before facing any zombie hoard.

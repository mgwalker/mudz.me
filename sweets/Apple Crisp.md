## Ingredients

* 5 pounds McIntosh or Macoun apples
* Grated zest of 1 orange
* Grated zest of 1 lemon
* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

### Topping

* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup oatmeal
* 1 cup cold unsalted butter, diced

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter a 9 by 14 by 2-inch oval baking dish.

Peel, core, and cut the apples into large wedges. Combine the apples
with the zests, juices, sugar, and spices. Pour into the dish.

To make the topping, combine the flour, sugars, salt, oatmeal, and cold
butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle
attachment. Mix on low speed until the mixture is crumbly and the butter
is the size of peas. Scatter evenly over the apples.

Place the crisp on a sheet pan and bake for 1 hour until the top is
brown and the apples are bubbly. Serve warm.

title: Spicy Chocolate Pecan Cookies
---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 Tablespoon orange zest
* 3/4 cup all-purpose four
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon espresso powder
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne
* 1/2 cup rolled oats, not instant
* 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 3/4 cup chopped roasted pecans

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F. Lightly grease or line with parchment paper two baking sheets.

Cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth. Add the egg, vanilla, and orange zest, and beat until creamy. Whisk together the flour, cocoa power, espresso powder, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne. Add the dry mixture to the liquid mixture. Stir until well combined. Stir in the oats, chocolate chips, and pecans.

Working in batches, form the dough into 1-Tablesoon balls (if it’s too soft, you can place it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes), and then place them on the prepared baking sheets 2 inches apart.

Bake one sheet at a time, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies have expanded and puffed. When they come out of the oven, the cookies will still be soft but as they cool, the cookies both harden and flatten. Cool on the sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling. Repeat for the remaining cookie dough.

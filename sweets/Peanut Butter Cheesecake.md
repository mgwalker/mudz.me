title: Peanut Butter Cheesecake
---

## Ingredients


### Crust

* 1/2 (14-ounce) box graham crackers (2 cups crumbs)
* 1/2 cup salted peanuts
* 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips
* 4 tablespoons soft unsalted butter

### Filling

* 16 oz cream cheese
* 3 eggs
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 cup superfine sugar
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1 cup creamy peanut butter

### Topping

* 1 cup sour cream
* 1 cup milk chocolate chips
* 2 tablespoons light brown sugar

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Process the crackers, peanuts, bittersweet
chocolate chips, and butter in a food processor. Once it comes together
in a clump, turn it into a springform pan and press into the bottom and
up the sides to make the crunchy crust. Put it in the refrigerator while
you make the filling.

Add all the filling ingredients to a food processor and pulse until it
becomes a smooth mixture.

Pour and scrape the filling into the crust and bake for 1 hour, checking
after 45 minutes. The top, only, should feel set and dry.

Take the cheesecakes out of the oven and set aside while you make the
topping. Warm the sour cream and milk chocolate with the brown sugar in
a small saucepan over a low heat. Gently whisk to blend in the chocolate
as it melts, then take the pan off the heat.

Spoon and spread the topping very gently over the top of the cheesecake,
being as careful so as not to break the surface. Put it back in the oven
for a final 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and cool
completely before refrigerating.

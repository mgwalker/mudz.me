## Ingredients


### Cake

* 2 cups flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 1 cup hot water

### Icing

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Butter and flour a 13-inch by 9-inch baking
dish.

Combine the sugar, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cocoa powder
in a large heatproof bowl. Beat together the hot water and mayonnaise,
then add to the dry ingredients. Add the vanilla, mix until well
combined, and pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 30 minutes,
then leave to cool.

Melt the butter in a small pan, turn off the heat, then whisk in the
cocoa powder, vanilla, and milk. Gradually mix in powdered sugar until
the icing becomes stiff. Spread evenly over the cooled cake.

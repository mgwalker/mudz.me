## Ingredients

* 1 cup honey
* 1 1/3 cup spelt flour (or equal parts wheat flour and wholemeal wheat
* flour)
* 90 grams butter
* 1 egg
* 2 Tablespoons milk
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* pinch of all spice
* pinch of ground cardamom
* pinch of black pepper
* pinch of salt

## Directions

Heat the milk, honey, and butter to a simmer over a low flame, then let
cool until lukewarm. Add the flour, eggs, spices, and salt. Work
vigorously until light and very sticky, then put in a large bowl. Cover
with a cloth and leave in a cool, dry place for at least 3 days, and up
to 3 weeks in the fridge.

Before baking, set in a warm place for an hour. Heat the oven to 325Â° F,
and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the dough on the
baking sheet and spread to about 1/2-inch thick. Bake for 15-20 minutes.
Leave to cool completely, slice into thirds, then layer the pieces
together with jam or toffee sauce.

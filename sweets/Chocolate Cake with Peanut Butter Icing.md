title: Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Icing
---

## Ingredients

* 1½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup superfine sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ⅓ cup best-quality cocoa
* 1½ sticks soft unsalted butter
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons good-quality vanilla extract
* ⅔ cup sour cream

## Directions

Take everything out of the refrigerator so that all ingredients can come
room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Mix the flour, sugar and leavening agents in a large bowl and beat in
the soft butter until well combined and creamy. Now whisk together the
cocoa, sour cream, vanilla, and eggs and beat this into the butter
mixture.

Pour batter into two buttered and floured round cake pans and bake until
a cake tester comes out clean, 25-35 minutes.

## Icing

1/2 cup butter, softened

1 cup creamy peanut butter

3 tablespoons milk, or as needed

2 cups confectioners\' sugar

Beat together butter and peanut butter. Alternate beating in sugar and
milk until all sugar is incorporated and icing is thick and spreadable.

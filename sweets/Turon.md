## Ingredients

* 24 8-inch square lumpia or spring roll wrappers
* 4 very ripe plantains
* 1 12-ounce jar jackfruit in syrup
* Vegetable oil, for frying

## Directions

Place a wire rack on a baking sheet and set aside.

Trim both ends of each plantain and do not remove the skin. Cut each plantain in half across and then cut lengthwise into 3 planks. Peel the plantain pieces.

Drain the jackfruit and reserve the syrup in a small bowl. Cut each piece of jackfruit into 1/2-inch wide strips. Reserve the syrup.

To assemble the turon, lay the wrapper on a clean surface. Place one slice of plantain horizontally about 2 inches from one corner and top with 2 strips of jackfruit. Fold the nearest corner of the wrapper over the plantain and jackfruit tightly and roll twice over. Fold in the left and right corners and continue to roll until about 1 inch of wrapper remains. Dip your finger into the reserved jackfruit syrup to moisten the top corner and seal. Repeat with the remaining fruit and wrappers.

Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of oil. Heat to 350Â° F over medium heat.

Dip each turon into the jackfruit syrup, allowing any excess to drip off and carefully place into the oil. Fry, turning occasionally, in batches of 6 at a time until deep golden brown and crisp all over, about 3 minutes per side. Place the turon on the wire rack and let cool. Repeat with remaining turon. Serve hot.

## Ingredients

### Batter
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1 cup flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 Tablespoons cocoa powder
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
* 1/2 cup light brown sugar 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla
* 1 cup roasted, salted pecans, chopped
* 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 2 Tablespoons fresh orange zest 

### Topping
* 1 1/2 cups brewed coffee
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon chile powder 

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350°F. Place the butter in an oval baking dish, then place the skillet into the oven so the butter can melt. You can do this as the oven heats.

Meanwhile, to make the batter, stir together the flour, baking powder, and cocoa powder until well blended. Stir in the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, milk, vanilla, pecans, chocolate chips, and orange zest until combined.

When the butter has melted, remove the baking dish from the oven and pour the melted butter into the batter. Stir until well combined then spread the batter into the skillet.

For the topping, if it’s not already piping hot, bring the coffee to a boil. Stir together the sugar, cocoa powder, and cinnamon then sprinkle evenly on top of the batter in the skillet. Do not stir to combine, simply leave it on top. Evenly pour over the topping the hot coffee and do not stir.

Place the baking dish in the oven and bake 30-35 minutes uncovered or until bubbling and crusty on top. Serve warm with ice cream.

## Ingredients


### Cake

* 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 3 eggs, room temperature
* 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1 1/4 cups sour cream
* 2 1/2 cups cake flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

### Streusel

* 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* 3/4 cup chopped walnuts

### Glaze

* 1/2 cup powdered sugar
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.

Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
the paddle attachment for 4 to 5 minutes, until light. Add the eggs 1 at
a time, then add the vanilla and sour cream. In a separate bowl, sift
together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer
on low, add the flour mixture to the batter until just combined. Finish
stirring with a spatula to be sure the batter is completely mixed.

For the streusel, place the brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and
butter in a bowl and pinch together with your fingers until it forms a
crumble. Mix in the walnuts.

Spoon half the batter into the pan and spread it out with a knife.
Sprinkle with 3/4 cup streusel. Spoon the rest of the batter in the pan,
spread it out, and scatter the remaining streusel on top. Bake for 50-60
minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean.

Let cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the
cake, streusel side up, onto a serving plate. Whisk the confectioners\'
sugar and maple syrup together, adding a few drops of water if
necessary, to make the glaze runny. Drizzle over the cake with a fork or
spoon.

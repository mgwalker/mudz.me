## Ingredients

* 1 cup flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1 pinch ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel
* 1/4 cup ground almonds
* 6 Tablespoons butter
* 1 egg
* 2 teaspoons milk

## Directions

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon. Stir
in the lemon peel and almonds. Cut in the butter until the mixture
resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the egg and milk until the mixture
forms a ball. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

Heat the oven to 400Â°F.

Roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into circles 1-3/4
inches in diameter. Place on a lined baking sheet and sprinkle with
sugar. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes until edges are brown.

### Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â° F.

Cream the butter, sugar, vanilla, and lemon extract until light. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift together the flour, salt, cream of tartar, and baking soda. Combine the strawberry jam and sour cream, adding alternately with the dry ingredients. Stir in the nuts. Pour into small loaf pans.

Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 30 - 40 minutes. Makes seven small loaves.

For the frosting, cream together the butter, vanilla, lemon zest, 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice, and 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar in a mixer. Gradually add more powdered sugar until the frosting reaches your desired consistency. Spread over the top of the cooled loaves.

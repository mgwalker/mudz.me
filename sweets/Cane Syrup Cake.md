## Ingredients

* 1 stick butter, softened
* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 cups cane syrup
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla

## Directions

Heat oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour a tube pan, and set aside.

In a mixer, cream butter and sugar together until fluffy. Mix in syrup,
eggs, and vanilla, and beat until well blended.

In a bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to
the syrup mixture, alternating with the buttermilk and mixing thoroughly
after each addition.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake 45-60 minutes, until
springy to the touch.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* Pinch of salt

## Directions

Heat the oven to 325Â° F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.

Melt the butter in a saucepan, then turn off the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.

In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, flour, pecans, and salt. Add to the cocoa-butter mixture and stir until just combined.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and bake 30 - 35 minutes. Allow to cool, then cut into bars.

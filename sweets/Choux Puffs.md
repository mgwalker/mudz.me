title: Choux Puffs
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup (235 grams) water
* 6 Tablespoons (84 grams) unsalted butter, cubed
* 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) kosher salt
* 128 grams flour, sifted
* 4 large eggs (200 grams)

## Directions

Heat the oven to 400° F.

In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt. Set over high and and cook until liquid comes to a rolling boil and butter has fully melted, about 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat and add the flour. Using a wooden spoon, thoroughly mix in the flour until no lumps remain. Return the saucepan to medium-high heat and cook, stirring very frequently, until the dough registers 175° F (80° C) on an instant-read thermometer.

Transfer the dough to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and beat at medium speed until the dough registers 145° F on an instant-read thermometer. Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each is fully beaten into the dough before adding the next. Scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl, then mix once more at medium speed just to ensure the choux batter is fully mixed, about 5 seconds.

Transfer the dough to a pastry bag. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Pipe out nine 2-inch puffs on each baking sheet, spaced 3 inches apart. Smooth over the tops with a wet finger.

Bake until the choux is puffed, golden brown, and hollow feeling, about 25 minutes. Working quickly while puffs are still hot, gently insert the tip of a paring knife into the underside of each puff and rotate in a circular motion to create a small hole, about 1/4-inch in size. 

Return the puffs to the baking sheets and place in the turned-off oven with the door partially open for 30 minutes.

Cool completely, then fill as desired.

Unfilled puffs can be stored in the freezer for up to 1 month. To refresh the puffs, heat the oven to 350° F. Transfer the frozen puffs to a baking sheet and reheat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Let cool at room temperature before filling.

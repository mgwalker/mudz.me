title: Super Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups light brown sugar, packed
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1" pieces
* 1/2 cup whole milk
* 2 3/4 cups bread flour, divided
* 2 large eggs, cold from the refrigerator
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Directions

In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and salt. Set aside.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 - 7 minutes, until it’s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.

Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.

In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 Tablespoons of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain. Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it’s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 - 3 minutes.

Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth. Add the remaining bread flour, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.

Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 - 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.

Remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for 10 - 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Heat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the center.

Scoop the dough into walnut-sized portions and place on a lined baking sheet 2 - 3 inches apart.

Bake for 15 - 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.

title: Pecan Nut Crust
---

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups ground pecans
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Directions

Stir together ground nuts, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix in melted butter.

Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch,
deep-dish style, pie pan. Chill the unbaked crust in the refrigerator
for about 30 to 45 minutes.

Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Place the crust on a cookie sheet, and position
on the middle rack. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
(Watch it carefully, as nut crusts burn easily; they do not have to turn
black to taste burnt.) Cool completely before filling.

---

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1/2 cup peanut butter
* 3/4 cup sugar, divided
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 egg, at room temperature
* 2 Tablespoons milk
* 1 3/4 cup flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda

## Directions

In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the butter, peanut butter, 1/2 cup of the sugar, the brown sugar, the vanilla, and the salt until smooth. Beat in the egg and the milk. Gradually beat in the flour and baking soda until completely incorporated. Scrape down the bowl and refrigerate the dough, 30 minutes - 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 375Â° F. Portion the dough into walnut-sized balls, and gently roll them in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar until coated. Arrange 2 inches apart on baking sheets, and bake for 10 - 12 minutes.

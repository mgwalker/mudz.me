---

## Ingredients


### Pastry

* 100 grams powdered sugar
* 200 grams all purpose flour
* 45 grams cocoa powder
* 40 grams ground oats
* 2 pinches table salt
* 150 grams unsalted butter, chilled, plus extra for greasing
* 50 grams beaten egg
* 1 medium egg, for egg wash

### Filling

* 10 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 210 grams dark chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids), chopped
* 140 grams sugar
* 110 grams light brown sugar
* 50 grams golden syrup or light corn syrup
* 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 125 grams sour cream
* 45 grams cocoa powder
* 6 large egg yolks

### Raspberry jam

* 420 grams raspberries
* 75 grams sugar
* 2 Tablespoons pectin

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350° F. Spread the pecans into a single layer on a
baking sheet. Roast in the oven 5-10 minutes, checking frequently to
avoid burning. Set aside to cool. Turn the oven up to 400° F.

Grease and line a 10-inch tart tin.

For the chocolate pastry, add the dry ingredients to a food processer
and pulse briefly to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture
resembles breadcrumbs. Add the beaten egg and pulse until the dough
comes together (do not over process). Briefly knead the dough, then wrap
in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Roll out the pastry to 1/8-inch thick and use it to line the tart tin.
Prick all over with a fork and place in the freezer for 10 minutes. Line
the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake
for 12 minutes, then remove the beans and parchment, brush with the egg
wash and return to the oven for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool in the tin.

For the filling, heat the butter in a saucepan over a low heat. When
melted add the dark chocolate and stir to combine. Stir in the sugars,
syrup and salt. Add the soured cream, cocoa powder, egg yolks, and
pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour into the pastry case and bake
for 12 minutes, then turn the tart around and bake for a further 10
minutes. Set aside to cool on a wire rack for a few minutes then
transfer to the fridge to chill.

For the raspberry jam, break up the raspberries in a food processor and
pass through a sieve to remove the seeds. Heat the purée, sugar, and
pectin in a saucepan over medium heat until it turns thick and gels on a
cold spoon. Allow to cool and thicken slightly before pouring onto the
chilled pie filling. Chill in the fridge until ready to serve.

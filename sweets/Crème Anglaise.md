## Ingredients

* 4 egg yolks
* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 1/2 Tablespoons sour cream
* 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise

## Directions

In a medium mixing bowl, using a whip, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until they are very pale yellow and smooth.

In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, sour cream, and vanilla bean with its scrapings, and bring to a boil. Whisk about half into the egg yolk mixture until well combined, then pour back into the saucepan. Over medium heat, stirring constantly, cook until the mixture heavily coats the back of the spoon.

Strain through a sieve into a clean bowl and set the bowl over ice cubes and cold water until chilled, stirring occasionally. Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

title: Chocolate Date Fruitcake
---

## Ingredients

* 4 cups chopped dates
* 2 cups chocolate chips
* 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 Tablespoons orange zest
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk

## Directions

Heat the oven to 350Â°F, and grease and flour a 13-inch by 9-inch baking pan, or a 9-inch by 5-inch loaf pan.

In a mixing bowl, combine together the chopped dates, chocolate chips, coconut, flour, orange zest, and salt until well combined. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk, and stir until a thick, sticky batter forms.

Spread the fruitcake batter into the baking pan and then bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes or until the top is lightly brown. Be careful not to over bake it, as it will harden as it cools. Allow to cool for 30 minutes before slicing.

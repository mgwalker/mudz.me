title: Mexican Chocolate Fudge
---

## Ingredients

* 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2/3 cup half and half
* 4 cups mini marshmallows
* 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* Pinch cayenne (optional)
* 1 cup chopped roasted pecans

## Directions

Lightly grease an 8-inch square pan and line with parchment paper.

In a medium saucepan, while stirring, heat the butter, sugar, and half
and half on low heat until melted and well combined.

Stir in the marshmallows, turn the heat up to medium, and while
continuing to stir bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes until all the
marshmallows are melted and well combined.

Turn off the heat and stir in the chocolate chips, vanilla, cinnamon,
cayenne, salt, and pecans until well combined. The chocolate chips
should melt immediately and the mixture will be thick.

Spread the fudge evenly into the prepared pan and refrigerate covered
for 2 hours or until set. To serve, lift the fudge out of the pan and
cut into 16 (or 32, if you prefer) pieces.

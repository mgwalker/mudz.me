title: Lemon Curd
---

## Ingredients

* 4 large eggs
* Zest and juice of 4 lemons
* 300 grams sugar
* 1 cup butter, cut into pieces

## Directions

Break the eggs into a saucepan and whisk to combine. Stir in the
remaining ingredients and place over a medium heat.

Whisk continuously over the heat until the mixture coats the back of a
spoon and is slightly thickened -- this could take 7--10 minutes. Do not
allow the mixture to boil or it may split.

Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Spoon into a sterilized jar,
seal, and leave to thicken.

title: Praline Pecans
---

## Ingredients

* 2 cups white sugar
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 6 tablespoons light corn syrup
* 4 cups pecans
* 1 heaping Tablespoon unsalted butter
* 2/3 cup milk

## Directions

Mix all the ingredients very well in a cold pan.

Turn the stove on medium high heat, and when the mixture comes to a
boil, cook and stir for 4 minutes. (If you use a candy thermometer,
temperature should be 234Â° F.)

Remove from the heat. Stir for about 1 minute or until the mixture is
not so glossy. Spoon the pralines onto trays lined with foil or
parchment paper. Let cool for about 20 minutes and remove.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup butter
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup honey
* 4 egg yolks
* 2 1/2 cups spelt flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 Tablespoon nutmeg
* 1 Tablespoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon cloves

## Directions

Heat the oven to 375Â° F.

Melt the butter, then add it to a medium bowl with the sugar, honey, and egg yolks. Beat gently, then fold in the rest of the ingredients. Refrigerate the dough for an hour.

Turn out the dough on a lightly-floured surface, then roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thick. Cut the dough into small circles using a cookie cutter or an upturned glass. Place the cookies on a lined baking sheet.

Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
